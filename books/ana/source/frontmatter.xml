        <p>Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text. An
exercise set appears at the end of each chapter. The nature of the
exercises ranges over several categories; computational,  conceptual,
and theoretical problems are included. A section presenting hints and
solutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text. Often
in the solutions a proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student
to provide the details. The exercises range in difficulty from very easy
to very challenging. Many of the more substantial problems require
careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the
	solution is not forthcoming after a few minutes of work.</p>
