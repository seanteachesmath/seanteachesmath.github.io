<p>A total of <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> iterations of each problem are shown in the color figure above. Time is indicated in two ways: on the graph early steps are in dark blue and fade to yellow. Along the axis earlier approximations are marked by tall (also dark blue) tick marks and later iterations are marked by shorter (also yellow) tick marks. The scaling of the above-axis tick marks is nothing quantitative or necessarily related to the values of the approximation itself, it is just meant to show the progression of the iterations.</p>
