<p>For two problems starting from <span class="process-math">\(p_0=1\text{,}\)</span> we see the iterations approaching the fixed point visible on each panel of the graph. Solutions to the first fixed-point problem (left) converge very slowly, while those to the second (right) converge very quickly. Details of the approaches to the fixed points are interesting as well. Approximations converging to the true solution of <span class="process-math">\(p=0\)</span> for the first problem decrease monotonically, while those converging to the true solution of the second problem oscillate.</p>
