<title>The Plan</title>

<p> We look at a few applications of the definite integral.
</p>

<p> Given that <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are continuous
and that <m>f(x)\geq g(x)</m> on the interval from <m>x=a</m> to
<m>x=b</m>, the area between the curves <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> from
<m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is given by <me>\int_a^b \left(f(x) -
g(x)\right)\,dx</me>
</p>

<p> <sq>Degree-days</sq> are used as a way to measure growth
and development in plants and other temperature-dependent species, such
as insects.
</p>

<p> Find the area between the curves <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m> and
<m>g(x)=x^{3}</m> between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
</p>

<p> The average value for a function <m>f(x)</m> on the
interval from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is <me>\boxed{\text{average value
of $f$} = \hat f = \hspace{2cm}\phantom{\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,
dx}}</me>
</p>

<p> An oil company describes the rate of change in
consumption of oil resources (in billions of barrels) using the equation
<m>\displaystyle \frac{dc}{dt} = 1.2e^{0.04t}</m> with <m>t=0</m>
indicating the year 1998.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> <p> Using a definite integral, compute the total resource
consumption over the first ten years since 1998.<!-- linebreak
--><em>Note: Be sure to transform the limits of integration if you use
<m>u</m>-substitution!</em></p> </li>

<li> <p> What is the average rate of consumption over the period?</p>
</li>

<li> <p> Repeat these two steps for the next ten years, the
period from 2008 to 2018.</p> </li>

</ol></p>

<p> In 1998, the above company estimated 30 billion barrels
in the reserve. Compute the definite integral that gives the total
consumption over the first <m>T</m> years since 1998,
<me>\int_{0}^T\,1.2e^{0.04t}\,dt,</me> and use the resulting formula to
find how many years it will take for the 30 billion barrel supply to be
exhausted. <em>Note: Set the result of the definite integral equal to 30
and solve for <m>T</m>.</em>
</p>

<p>	Consider the following situation as a brief
justification for the average value formula quoted above.

<p>	During an experiment to test the effects of a
dietary supplement on growth of quail, a researcher takes weekly
measurements of the mass of a bird in ounces.<!-- linebreak -->

<p>	What is the average mass of the bird during the
study?

<paragraphs xml:id="a-problem">
<title>A problem</title>

<p> The mass of the animal varies continuously with
time according to some function <m>m(t)</m>. What if we were to choose
different times for our measurement? How would our average mass change?
What other methods might we have to compute the average mass over an
<term>interval</term>?
</p>

<p> Consider the function <m>m(t) = -t^{2}+6t + 6</m>
that describes the mass of the quail during the growth experiment. Use
the definite integral to calculate the average mass of the bird during
the study? How does this compare to your earlier results?
