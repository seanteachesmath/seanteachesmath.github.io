<p> We continue our work on integration by introducing
exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as those involving
compositions.<!-- linebreak -->

<p>	We have learned a lot of techniques of
differentiation. We will only learn how to undo a few of these, such as
those derivatives involving <m>e^x</m>, <m>\ln(x)</m>, and the chain
rule. For example, we omit the method required to <sq>undo</sq>
derivatives computed with the product rule.

<paragraphs xml:id="derivatives-of-ex-and-lnx">
<title>Derivatives of <m>e^x</m> and
<m>\ln(x)</m></title>

<p> Recall from our earlier work that
<m>\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)=e^x</m> and
<m>\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(\ln{(x)})=\frac{1}{x}</m>.<!-- linebreak
-->What consequences do these facts have when we approach this problem
from integration? Our new approach is to ask <sq>what (unknown) function
has a derivative that matches the integrand?</sq> rather than to ask
<sq>what is the derivative of the (known) function?</sq> In other words,
<sq>where did this derivative come from?</sq>

<p> Since the indefinite integral undoes the action
of the derivative <me>\boxed{\int e^x \, dx=e^x +c}</me>

<title>Undoing differentiation by the Chain
Rule</title>

<p> Recall that the Chain Rule says that
<me>\boxed{\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f\circ
g\Big)=\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(g(x))\Big)=\frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}}</me> We
can undo the chain rule using integration by a substitution process as
well.
</p>

<p> Before we begin, we need a brief definition for
the <term>differential</term> <m>du</m>. For <m>u=g(x)</m>, the
differential is defined as <me>\boxed{du = g'(x)\,dx}</me>
</p>

<p> This is often called
<sq><m>u</m>-substitution</sq> since we think of <m>u</m> as the name
assigned to the inside function <m>g(x)</m> from the Chain Rule. To
outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the
variable <m>x</m>, though where you see an <m>x</m> below you can
imagine another variable such as <m>t</m>.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> <p> Define a new variable, called <m>u=g(x)</m>, as
some function of the old variable <m>x</m>.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Compute the differential <m>du = g'(x)\,dx</m>.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Put everything in the integral in terms of the
new variable, <m>u</m>.<!-- linebreak -->(Replace the <sq>inside
function</sq> by the letter <m>u</m> and replace what remains by the
definition for <m>du</m>.) Sometimes we have to rearrange a bit here so
that <m>du</m> fits back in the integral.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Try to integrate in terms of the new variable,
<m>u</m>.</p> </li>

<p> The growth of female Atlantic sturgeon (fish) in
the Hudson River, New York, approximately follows the differential
equation <me>\displaystyle\frac{dL}{dt}=19.56e^{-0.074t}</me> with
<m>L(0)=14.65</m> (age in yr, length in cm, measured from hatching).
Solve this differential equation.

female sturgeon to mature?
