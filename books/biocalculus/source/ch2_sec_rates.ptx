<title>Change</title>

<p>	Change, key to science (and calculus), is conveyed
by the . When we talk about change it is helpful to note,
</p>

<p><ul>
<li><p><m>\Delta</m> is mathematical shorthand for change
in a variable:<!-- linebreak --><m>\Delta t</m> typically means change
in time <m>t</m>,<!-- linebreak --><m>\Delta x</m> typically means
change in variable <m>x</m>, and so on</p> </li>

<li><p>	we often talk about rates of change</p> </li>

</ul></p>


<example xml:id="ex-rates-of-change">
<title>Rates of change</title>
<statement>
<p> Consider a bacteria population <m>b(t)</m>
measured as a function of time <m>t</m>, we can describe two kinds of
change
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> average rate of change:<!-- linebreak
--><me>\text{average rate of change} =
\frac{\hspace{5cm}}{\hspace{5cm}} = \frac{\text{change in
}\hspace{1cm}}{\text{change in }\hspace{1cm}} =
\frac{\hspace{1cm}}{\hspace{1cm}}</me></p> </li>
<li> <p> instantaneous rate of change:<!-- linebreak

<p> Rates of change have units! There should be more
than one correct answer for each option.

<title>Lines, secant lines, and rates of
change</title>

<p> When talking about the average rate of change of
a measurement we compute the ratio of change in output over change in
input (often time). This ratio is also the slope of a line that we call
the secant line.
</p>

<p> The secant line connects two points that lie on
the graph of a function. We call one of the points the <term>base
point</term>.
</p>

<p> <em>When we pick our two points on a graph, we
are still computing the slope of a line through these points (even
though it has a new name – the secant line).<!-- linebreak --></em>
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-slope-two-ways">
<statement>
<p> Compute the slope of the line that connects the
points <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(3, 9)</m>.
</p>

<p> <term>The line:</term>
</p>

<p> Compute the slope of the line that connects the
points at <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m> on the graph of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>.
</p>

<p> <term>The secant line:</term>
</p>

<p> <term>Conclusion:</term>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p> Below we plot temperature data (<m>{}^\circ
F</m> vs <m>t</m>) with a sketch of a smooth function to describe the
trend. Sketch a secant line to connect the initial point to a point
<m>\Delta t</m> minutes away on the graph (use <em>your</em> <m>\Delta
t</m> from the demo)
</p>

<figure>
<image source="sketch.png" width = "50%"/>

</figure>

<p> How well does your secant line capture the trend
of the data?
</p>

<p> Consider the function <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> and the
base point at <m>x_{0}=1</m>. Find average rates of change and secant
lines that connect this base point to other points on the graph located
<m>\Delta x = 1, 0.5, 0.1, \text{and } 0.01</m> away.
</p>

<p> Guess the slope of the tangent line to
<m>f(x)</m> at <m>x_{0}=1</m>, based on the work above. Recall, the
tangent line is the line that touches (but doesn’t cross) the graph of
the function at the indicated point

<title>Quick practice</title>

<exercise><statement> <p> What is a rate that you are familiar or
comfortable
with, and thinking of that rate as the slope between two points on a
graph, what measurements would the corresponding axes on that graph
represent?</p> </statement>
<solution><p> Most of what I understand in physics is limited to the
fact that velocity describes the change in position relative to the
change in time. This means the vertical axis on the corresponding graph
would be <sq>position</sq> and the horizontal axis would be
<sq>time</sq>.</p>

<exercise><statement> <p> The height of a plant at two time points is
given by the
values <m>h(2) = 3.4</m> and <m>h(8) = 6.9</m> what is the average rate
of change in height over the interval? Height is in centimeters and time
is in weeks.</p> </statement>

values <m>h(2) = 3.4</m> and <m>h(8) = 6.9</m>, the average rate of
change in height over the interval is <me>\dfrac{\Delta h}{\Delta t} =
