<p> We will extend our notion of <sq>slope</sq> to allow
ourselves to make precise descriptions of how values of all functions,
not just linear functions, change.

<title>Average and instantaneous rates of
change</title>

<p>	Consider the function <m>f(t)</m>, perhaps
describing the position of a frog while it crosses a pond, graphed
below. Assume that <m>f</m> is measured in meters and <m>t</m> in
seconds.<!-- linebreak -->

<p>	The slope of the secant line that connects the
points <m>(a, f(a))</m> and <m>(b, f(b))</m> on the graph of <m>f(t)</m>
is, <me>m_{sec} = \dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta
t},</me> which we call the <em>average rate of change</em> of
<m>f(t)</m> between <m>t~=~a</m> and <m>t~=~b</m>, in meters per second.
</p>

<p>	By bringing <m>b</m> closer and closer to <m>a</m>,
our secant line becomes a tangent line. To do this we introduce a limit,
<me>m_{tan} = \lim_{b\rightarrow a}\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},</me> which we
call the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em> of <m>f(t)</m> at
<m>t~=~a</m>, again in meters per second.

<title>Aside (<m>b\rightarrow a</m> vs. <m>\Delta
t\rightarrow 0</m>)</title>

<p> Last time in our limit definition, we used the
limit as <m>\Delta t\rightarrow0</m>. We will briefly show why that is
equivalent to the approach above and <em>computationally</em> easier.
Since <m>\Delta t = b-a</m>, we have <m>b=a+\Delta t</m>. Taking
<m>b\rightarrow a</m> is the same as taking <m>\Delta t \rightarrow
0</m>. Substitute <m>b=a+\Delta t</m> in the definition for
<m>m_{tan}</m> and simplify, <me>\begin{aligned}
m_{tan} &amp; = \lim_{b\rightarrow a}\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\
&amp; = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta
t)-f(a)}{(a+\Delta t)-a}\\
m_{tan} &amp; = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta
t)-f(a)}{\Delta t}\end{aligned}</me>

<title>The derivative</title>

<p> We define the <em>instantaneous rate of
change</em> at <m>t=a</m> to be the <em>slope of the tangent line</em>
to <m>f(t)</m> at <m>t=a</m>, given by the <em>derivative</em>
<m>f'(a)</m>, below,
</p>

<p> <me>\boxed{\text{inst. rate of change} = m_{tan}
= f'(a) = \left.\dfrac{df}{dt}\right|_{t=a} = \lim_{\Delta
t\rightarrow0}\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta
t\rightarrow0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta t)-f(a)}{\Delta t}}</me> inside this
limit, the change in output is <m>\Delta f = f(a+\Delta t)-f(a)</m>
while the change in input is simply <m>\Delta t</m>.

<paragraphs xml:id="shorthand">
<title>Shorthand</title>

<p> Rather than using the two symbols required to
write <m>\Delta t</m>, we often use a single symbol <m>h</m> to denote
the change from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> in the definition (and in the
picture above). This amounts to saying that <m>b= a+h</m> rather than
<m>b=a+\Delta t</m> (since <m>h=\Delta t</m>), so that the derivative of
<m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m> is <me>\boxed{f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow
0}\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}</me>

<title>Higher derivatives</title>

<p> We will learn how to interpret some higher
derivatives soon, but we can already differentiate quite a few
functions. We’ll cover this soon, but you might as well try computing
the second derivatives, as illustrated below. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{first derivative} = f'(x) &amp; = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f(x)\Big) =
\dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(\text{the function}\Big)\\
\text{second derivative} = f''(x) &amp; = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f'(x)\Big) =
\dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(\text{the derivative}\Big)\end{aligned}</me> The
mechanics are just the same. For problems involving exponentials and
logarithms be sure to simplify as fully as possible first using log
rules, otherwise we might not know what to do to compute the derivative!

<title>Quick practice</title>

<exercise><statement> <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x) =
3x-7</m>?</p> </statement>
<solution>
<p> The derivative of <m>f(x) = 3x-7</m> is <m>f'(x) =
\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(3x-7\right) = 3</m>. The derivative of a linear
function is its slope.</p>
</solution>

<exercise><statement> <p> Where is the critical point of <m>f(x) =
2x^{2}-7x+3</m>
given that <m>f'(x) = 4x-7</m>?</p> </statement>
<solution>
<p> The critical point of <m>f(x) = 2x^{2}-7x+3</m> is found
by setting its derivative, <m>f'(x) = 4x-7</m>, equal to zero and
solving for <m>x</m>. So, <m>0=4x-7</m>, solved for <m>x</m> gives <m>x
= \dfrac{7}{4}</m>.</p>

<exercise><statement> <p> If the derivative is positive at some point,
is the
function increasing or decreasing at that point?</p> </statement>
