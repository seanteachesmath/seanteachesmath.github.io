<title>The Plan</title>

<p> Dimensions and units are critical to our ability to
collect data, make valid quantitative and even qualitative comparisons,
and draw conclusions.

<title>Measurements have units (e.g., cm, pounds,
liters)</title>

<p>	We use identities to move between units and we use
<term>fundamental relations</term> (e.g., geometry formulas) to move
between dimensions.

<p> To compare quantities we need a common unit, we
convert to a common unit, or we give up.

<p> To convert between units, multiply by

<title>Keeping track of units on functions</title>

<p> When appropriate we want to make good use of the
benefits of function notation and function manipulation, while
preserving the unit of the underlying measurement. In particular, we
want to be able to use given information to determine when we are
evaluating a function (units of the input) or solving an equation (units
of the output).
</p>

<p> Consider two mathematical functions used to
represent the change in these quantities, <m>r(t) = \textit{radius of a
colony as a function of time}</m> and <m>A(r) = \textit{area of a colony
as a function of radius}</m>.

<li> <p> What are dimensions and sensible units for each?</p> </li>
<li> <p> How can we combine these functions
(measurements) to define other realistic measurements?</p> </li>

<exercise xml:id="quick-units-area">
<statement> <p> Oklahoma’s State Champion Sparkleberry
tree<fn> <p> read more here <url
href="http://www.forestry.ok.gov/champion-trees">http://www.forestry.ok.
gov/champion-trees</url>
</p></fn> has a diameter at breast height of <m>5.1</m>
inches, convert this to centimeters.
</p></statement>
<solution>
Oklahoma’s State Champion Sparkleberry tree has a
diameter at breast height of <m>5.1</m> inches, as any good scientist
should, we convert this to centimeters using <me>\dfrac{5.1\text{
inches}}{1}\cdot\dfrac{2.54 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ inches}} = \dfrac{5.1
\cancel{\text{ inches}}}{1}\cdot\dfrac{2.54 \text{ cm}}{1 \cancel{\text{
inches}}} = 12.93 \text{ centimeters}</me>.
</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise><statement> <p> Given the diameter found in Question <xref
ref="quick-units-area" /> (in centimeters), what is the area of the
corresponding cross-sectional slice of tree?
</p></statement>
<solution>
Given the diameter found in Question <xref
ref="quick-units-area" /> (in centimeters) we need to find the radius
before
computing the area. The radius is half of the diameter, <m>r = 6.46</m>,
so the area of the corresponding cross-sectional slice of tree is <m>A =
\pi r^{2} = \pi(6.46 \text{ cm})^{2} =131.28 \text{ cm}^{2}</m>
