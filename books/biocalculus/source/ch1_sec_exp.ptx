<p> Logarithmic and exponential functions, while often
intimidating, appear throughout microbiology, chemistry, statistics, and
mathematics. We will understand the basic computational and graphical
properties of these functions and their connection to applications.

<p> A population of size <m>N</m> loses a factor of
approximately <m>\underline{\hspace{2cm}}</m> of its genetic variability
each generation. Consider a population of <m>N=20</m> individuals that
<term>loses</term> a factor of  each generation.<!-- linebreak -->A
population <term>maintains</term> a factor of
<m>\underline{\hspace{2cm}}</m> of its variability each generation. How
much variability is left after 5 generations?
</p>

<p> We have a <em>shortcut</em> for evaluating values like
this. Above each factor has a power of <m>\underline{\hspace{2cm}}</m>,
to simplify this calculation we can write the following:

<p> How much variability remains after 20 generations?

<title>Properties of exponents</title>
<statement>
<p>Consider the following laws for for real numbers
<m>a</m>, <m>m</m>, and <m>n</m>.

<ol>
<li> <p> <m>a^{m}\cdot a^{n} = a^{m+n}</m></p> </li>

<p> Common bases in science are
<ul>
<li> <p> <m>10</m> throughout science and nature</p> </li>
<li> <p> <m>e</m> throughout science</p> </li>
<li> <p> <m>2</m> throughout computer science</p> </li>
</ul></p>

<p> Though we think of exponents as <sq>multiplying
<m>a</m>’s together</sq> certain instance only make sense if we use the
above laws. How can we multiply factors of <m>2</m> together <m>(-3)</m>
times?
</p>

<p> Using the common bases above, consider the following:

<paragraphs xml:id="a-few-graphs">
<title>A few graphs</title>

<p> To introduce the inverse function it is helpful
to think of powers of ten. Consider <me>1,000,000 = 10^6</me> To write
one million, we multiply <m>6</m> factors of <m>10</m>. We say,
<q><m>10</m> raised to the power <m>6</m> gives  <m>1,000,000</m>,</q>

<title>Doubling time</title>
<statement>
<p>Consider a population that grows according to
<me>p(t)=p_{0} e^{\alpha t},</me> where <m>p_{0}</m> is the initial
population size, and <m>\alpha</m> is the growth rate.

<p> At what value will the population be twice its
initial size?

<p> Consider a chemical sample that undergoes decay
according to <me>s(t)=s_{0} e^{\alpha t},</me> where <m>s_{0}</m> is the
initial sample amount, and <m>\alpha&lt;0</m> is the decay rate.

<p> Island biogeographers have discovered that
<sq>large islands support more species than smaller islands.</sq> A
<term>power law</term> given by <me>S = cA^z,</me> has been used to
describe the relationship, where <m>S</m> is the number of species,
<m>A</m> is the area of the island, <m>c</m> is a baseline number of
species, and <m>z</m> describes how quickly species accumulate. Such a
relationship might look like the following:
</p>

<p> What do you notice about the data?
</p>

<p> The symbols <m>c</m> and <m>z</m> represent
<term>parameters</term> that are often <sq>fit</sq> from measurements.
To do so we often <sq>log-transform</sq> the relationship above (using
the log base 10, denoted <m>\log()</m> in the calculation below). Apply
the logarithm then laws of logarithms to both sides of <me>S = cA^z</me>
</p>

<p> This gives a  relationship between  and, that we
can use to more easily estimate parameters.
</p>

<p> Consider the famed mouse-elephant curve (with
other organisms included) that relates energy consumption (metabolic
rate) to body mass on a double-log plot.

<p> To generate alternative versions of the graph
using only the data within the boxed region of the
figure<fn><p> You might occasionally see (as below) an axis
with numbers of the form <m>3</m>, <m>10^{3}</m>, <m>1,000</m>. The
<m>3</m> refers to the base 10 log of the value, <m>10^{3}</m> refers to
the actual value in scientific notation, and <m>1000</m> is just the
normal value. Only in the first are we actually transforming the data.
</p></fn>, we use the log base 10 applied to the
power law relationship <me>E = aM^{b},</me> between <m>E</m> energy use
(metabolic rate) and body mass <m>M</m>. The derivation is as follows:
