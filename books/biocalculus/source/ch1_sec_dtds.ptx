<p>	An important part of mathematics and science is
describing the mechanisms by which measurements change and making a
testable prediction.

<title>Approach: Discrete-time dynamical
systems</title>

<p> Used to predict measurements made at discrete
time intervals (e.g., measurements made once per hour, day, week).
Consider a measurement <m>m_t</m> made at time <m>t</m>, to define a
discrete-time dynamical system (DTDS) we write <me>m_{t+1} =
f(m_t).</me>

from one day to the next.

<p> From the graph, predict the final area of your
colony if you initially measured an area of 10 mm<m>{}^{2}</m>?
</p>

<p> Mathematically what are you doing to make your
prediction?
</p>

<p> Let <m>y_t</m> denote the measured area
(mm<m>{}^{2}</m>) of the yeast measured on day <m>t</m>. Define the DTDS
that predicts the future measurement, called <m>y_{t+1}</m>.<!--

<p> The sequence of values <m>m_t</m> for <m>t = 0,
1, 2, \dots</m> is the <term>solution</term> of the discrete-time
dynamical system <m>m_{t+1} = f(m_t)</m> starting from initial condition
<m>m_{0}</m>. We sometimes graph the solution as a plot of points
against
time.

<p> For our yeast growth predictions, example
initial conditions above were <m>y_{0}=100</m> mm<m>{}^{2}</m> and
<m>y_{0}=10</m> mm<m>{}^{2}</m>. Using the updating function, compute
five
terms of the solution starting from each of these initial
conditions.<!-- linebreak -->

<p> A point <m>m^*</m> is called an equilibrium of
the DTDS <me>m_{t+1} = f(m_t)</me> if <m>f(m^*) = m^*</m> (i.e., if
