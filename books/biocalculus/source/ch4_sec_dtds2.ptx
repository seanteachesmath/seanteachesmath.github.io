<title>The Plan</title>

<p> By studying a few real-world mathematical models, we
will see a new dimension of mathematical work - more graphical and
artistic, but rooted in calculus nonetheless.<!-- linebreak -->

<title>Historical examples</title>

<p>	We will discuss two famous DTDS from the scientific
literature: the Ricker model and the discrete-logistic model.<!--

<p>	This model was used to study changes in fish
populations over a 4 year period (chosen based on the reproductive cycle
of the fish). The updating function (the curve) was chosen based on
fisheries data and modeling.

curves) are illustrated.

<p> We see a hint of a <sq>stability condition</sq>
in the right-hand panel. Recall that equilibria occur where the diagonal
and updating functions cross. The equilibrium point is
<term>stable</term> if the updating function is <sq>not too steep</sq>
at this point, and <term>unstable</term> if the updating function is
<sq>too steep</sq> at this point.<!-- linebreak -->What might we mean by

<p> From your computer experiments and analysis
above what conclusions can you draw about this model and its solutions?
</p>

<p> For the DTDS <m>x_{t+1} = f(x_t)</m>, the
equilibrium <m>x_{t+1} = x_t = x^*</m> is
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> <term>stable</term> if <m>-1 &lt;
f'(x^*)&lt;1</m> (or <m>f</m> has a small slope at <m>x^*</m>,
<m>|f'(x^*)|&lt;1</m>) and</p> </li>
<li> <p> <term>unstable</term> if <m>f'(x^*)&lt;-1</m> or
<m>1 &lt; f'(x^*)</m> (or <m>f</m> has a large slope at <m>x^*</m>,
<m>|f'(x^*)|&gt;1</m>)</p> </li>

</ul></p>

<p> The solution <m>x_t</m> oscillates of
<m>f'(x^*)&lt;0</m>.

<title>Big idea!</title>

<p> Near an equilibrium <m>f</m> looks like its
tangent line, whose slope is given by the derivative there,
<m>f'(x^*)</m>. Zooming in <em>near the equilibrium point</em>, the
nonlinear model will look like one of the four cases pictured at the
conclusion of the previous section with one of the basic behaviors.

<paragraphs xml:id="ricker-model">
<title>Ricker Model</title>

<p> Originally published in the 1950â€™s, the Ricker
model was used to describe change in size of fish populations from one
measurement to the next. Though there are other variants presented in
literature, the model is <me>N_{t+1} = rN_te^{-KNt},</me> where the
values <m>r</m> and <m>K</m> are parameters. This model has been used to
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> estimate growth and population parameters from
data</p> </li>
<li> <p> predict population growth</p> </li>
<li> <p> optimize yields from harvested populations</p> </li>

</ul></p>

<title>Analysis of the Ricker DTDS</title>

<p> To get some basic information we will analyze
the Ricker model by hand before moving onto computing.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> <p> With <m>r=2</m> and <m>K=2</m>, find the
equilibria <m>N^*</m> for the Ricker model.</p> </li>
<li> <p> What is <m>f'(N)</m> if <m>f(N) = rNe^{-KN}</m>?</p> </li>
<li> <p> What is <m>f'(N^*)</m>? Are equilibria stable?

<li> <p> Repeat the analysis if <m>r=8</m>.</p> </li>

<paragraphs xml:id="discrete-logistic">
<title>Discrete logistic</title>

<p> The famous model May discusses in the paper
cited above is the discrete logistic equation or the <sq>logistic
map,</sq> given by <me>x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t/K),</me> where <m>r</m> and
<m>K</m> are parameters and we think of <m>x_t</m> as describing the
size of a biological population. The algebra of the analysis simplifies
if we choose <m>K=1</m>.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> <p> With <m>r=2</m> and <m>K=1</m>, find the
equilibria <m>x^*</m> for the discrete logistic model.</p> </li>
<li> <p> What is <m>f'(x)</m> if <m>f(x) = rx(1-x/K)</m>
if again <m>K=1</m>?</p> </li>
<li> <p> What is <m>f'(x^*)</m>? Are equilibria stable?

<title>Note on modeling</title>

<p> Both of these models, and many others, are of
the form <me>N_{t+1} = N_tf(N_t),</me> where <m>f(N)</m> is the <sq>per
capita production</sq> as a function of the current population size.
This model tells us that the new population size is a multiple of the
old population size, and <m>f(N)</m> tells us what the multiple is. What
is <m>f</m> for each of the models above?
