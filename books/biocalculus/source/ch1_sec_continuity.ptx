<title>The Plan</title>

<p> Evaluating most limits (some of which we still need to
practice) can be a slow task. By studying a particular category of
functions – the <term>continuous functions</term> – we can introduce a
faster computational method for finding the value of a limit of a
function at a point.

<title>Intuitive definition of a continuous
function</title>

<p>	We tend to think of functions as being
<sq>continuous</sq> if we can draw the corresponding graph without
lifting our pencil (you should probably be graphing in pencil).

<paragraphs xml:id="jumps-and-holes-and-asymptotes">
<title>Jumps, and holes, and asymptotes</title>

<p> There are three major ways that a function can
fail to be continuous, that is, for it to encounter an input value, but
fail to produce an output:

<p> A function <m>f</m> is <term>continuous at a
point</term> <m>x=a</m> if <me>\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a).</me>
Otherwise, we say <m>f</m> is <term>discontinuous</term> at point
<m>x=a</m>.
</p>

<p> A function <m>f</m> is <term>continuous</term>
if it is continuous at all points in its domain (i.e., at each point
<m>x=a</m> it takes on the value that it should according to the value
of its limit).

<title>Important consequence!</title>

<p> If we are talking about the limit of a
continuous function at a point in its domain we can compute the limit by
evaluating the function at the point we are taking the limit. This is
helpful for many limits.

<example xml:id="example-continuity-linear">
<title>Continuity of a linear function</title>
<statement>
<p> Find the limit of <m>g(x) = 5x+6</m> as <m>x\to -1</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution> Since <m>g(x)</m> is a continuous function, we know that in general <m>\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a} g(x) = g(a)</m>.  So, <me>\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow -1} g(x) = g(-1)</me> and since <m>g(x) = 5x+6</m>, we have <me>g(-1) = 5(-1)+6 = 1.</me>  We have successfully used function evaluation to replace the more challenging limit problem.

<p> There are five basic continuous functions from
which others are built. We will focus on the first four in this class.

<title>Making new continuous functions</title>

<p> Given two continuous functions <m>f(x)</m> and
<m>g(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m> our hope is to build other continuous
functions. To do so, we can
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> add them <!-- linebreak --><m>\displaystyle h(x)=
f(x)+g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m></p> </li>
<li> <p> multiply them <!-- linebreak --><m>\displaystyle
h(x)= f(x)g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m></p> </li>
<li> <p> divide them <!-- linebreak --><m>\displaystyle
h(x)= \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>, provided that
<m>g(a)\neq0</m></p> </li>
<li> <p> compose them <!-- linebreak --><m>\displaystyle
h(x)= f(g(x))</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>, provided that <m>f(x)</m>
is continuous at <m>x=g(a)</m></p> </li>

</ul></p>

<p> Let’s use the graphs of our basic continuous
functions to build a few more complicated (but still continuous)
functions.

<exercises xml:id="quick-practice-continuity" class="unnumbered">
<title>Quick practice</title>


<exercise><statement> <p> Is the function <m>f(x) = 1</m>
continuous?</p> </statement>
<solution>
<p> The function <m>f(x) = 1</m> is continuous, it is the
constant function.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise><statement> <p> Is the function <m>g(x) = x+2</m>
continuous?</p> </statement>
<solution><p> The function <m>g(x) = x+2</m> is continuous, it is a
linear function.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise><statement> <p> Is the function <m>h(x) = \dfrac{1}{x+2}</m>
continuous?</p> </statement>
<solution><p> The function <m>h(x) = \dfrac{1}{x+2}</m> is not
continuous, since it is undefined for <m>x = -2</m>. The limit there
does not exist, so it could not possibly match the value of the
function, <m>f(-2)</m>, which incidentally is undefined.</p>
</solution>
