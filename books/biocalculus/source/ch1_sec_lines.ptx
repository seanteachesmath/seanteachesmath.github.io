<p> Linear functions are the basis for most relationships
that we can think about.

<definition xml:id="def-linear-function">
<title>linear function</title>
<statement><p> A relationship <m>f(x)</m> defined by
<ol>
<li> <p> <m>y=f(x)=mx+b</m>, with constants <m>m</m> and
<m>b</m>, or</p> </li>
<li> <p> <m>y=f(x)= y_{0} + m(x-x_{0})</m>, with constant <m>m</m>
and a point <m>(x_{0}, y_{0})</m></p> </li>
</ol>

is called a <term>linear function</term> between the
<em>variables</em> <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. If the formula involves only
adding and subtracting constants with variables multiplied by constants,
the equation describes a linear function.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p> The slope of a linear function passing through two
points <m>(x_{0}, y_{0})</m> and <m>(x_{1}, y_{1})</m> is defined as the
ratio
of the change in output over the change in input (<q>rise over run</q>),
</p>


<paragraphs xml:id="notation">
<title>Notation</title>

<p>	In general, in biological applications we rarely
have inputs/outputs called <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> â€“ for example we have
mass and volume. These labels, while different from what we are used to
are meant to make problems more meaningful!

<p>	Notice that the definition
<me>m=\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}</me> gives us all we need to
derive both
point-slope form and slope-intercept form. Let our point be <m>(x_{0},
y_{0})</m> and instead of <m>(x_{1}, y_{1})</m>, choose <m>(x, y)</m> to
be
any other point on the line.

<p>	Once again rewrite this as slope-intercept form.

<title>Interpolation</title>

<p> Frequently we use linear functions to
interpolate or predict values occurring between two known values. This
technique is called linear interpolation, and is illustrated in the
following example.

<example xml:id="ex-hiv-aids">
<statement>
<p> Here we look at the onset of AIDS symptoms in
the years after initial HIV infection. Four years after infection 17%
had symptoms, and seven years after infection 33% had symptoms.

<li> <p> Write the formula for a linear function that
relates the percent of patients with AIDS symptoms to time (years
measured since infection).</p> </li>
<li> <p> Define and interpret the slope and intercept
(units included).</p> </li>
<li> <p> How many patients (what percent) have symptoms
after five and a half years?</p> </li>
<li> <p> Using this model, at what time would you predict
that half of all exposed patients have AIDS symptoms? What must you do
to answer this question?</p> </li>

<exercises xml:id="quick-practice-linear" class="unnumbered">
<title>Quick practice</title>

<exercise xml:id="quick-linear-area"><statement> <p> In Question <xref
ref="quick-units-area" /> of the previous
section, we talked about the relationship between area and radius. Is
that relationship linear? Why or why not?
</p></statement>
<solution>
In Question <xref ref="quick-units-area" /> of the previous
section, we talked about the relationship between area and radius, <m>A
= \pi r^{2}</m>. This <em>is not</em> linear, since we must
<em>square</em> the radius to get the area.
</solution>
</exercise>


<exercise><statement> <p> In Question <xref ref="quick-linear-area" />
of the previous
section, we talked about the relationship between radius and diameter.
Is that relationship linear? Why or why not?
</p></statement>
<solution>
In Question <xref ref="quick-units-area" /> of the previous
section, we talked about the relationship between radius and diameter.
This <em>is</em> linear since <m>r = \dfrac{d}{2}</m>, in fact this is
proportional since the radius is a constant multiple
<m>\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)</m> of the diameter. This is a good
reminder that dividing by two is the same as multiplying by one half.
</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise><statement> <p> (This one might not be so quick practice.) In
chemistry
we use the Lineweaver-Burk or <sq>double-reciprocal</sq> plot to
determine properties of a chemical reaction. We graph a surprisingly
complicated looking, but still linear, relationship <me>\dfrac{1}{V} =
\dfrac{K_m}{V_{max}}\dfrac{1}{[S]} + \dfrac{1}{V_{max}}</me> where
<m>V</m> is the reaction rate or <sq>velocity</sq>, <m>[S]</m> is the
substrate concentration, and <m>V_{max}</m> and <m>K_m</m> are
<em>parameters</em> in the relationship between our original variables
<m>V</m> and <m>[S]</m>. Solve for <m>V</m> (not the reciprocal of
<m>V</m>) as a function of <m>[S]</m>.
</p></statement>
<solution>
In solving for <m>V</m> (steps not shown), we should
eventually come upon the formula <m>V=\dfrac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]}</m>.
This an example of a type of function we will study in more detail later
this semester.
</solution>

<exercise><statement> <p> Roughly speaking, the phrase <sq>is

Roughly speaking, the phrase <sq>is proportional to</sq>
