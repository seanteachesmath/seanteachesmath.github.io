<p> Welcome to what I hope is a fun, challenging, and rewarding
class. This packet of notes and a scientific calculator are really the
only things you should need for this class this semester. Each day weâ€™ll
work through a few pages together in class.
</p>

<p> Occasionally I will pass out supplemental notes when something
relevant hits the news or post notes online if we skip an example in the
interest of time. With a three-hole punch, you should easily be able to
add to these notes.
</p>

<p> With the exception of a few <sq>Quick Problems</sq> at the
end of each section, the one thing you should notice that is missing
from this packet is anything that resembles homework. The <sq>Quick
Problems</sq> and included answers are merely for your practice and will
not be collected. Most homework for this class will be posted and
submitted using a free online homework system. Occasionally I will have
you hand in written problems with graphs or explanations.
</p>

<p> While it might seem a bit wasteful, I have probably printed the
associated notes
one-sided to give you additional space for writing, drawing, or scratch
work.
</p>

<p> Our first test covers Topics 1 to 7, our second test covers
Topics 8 to 14, our third test covers Topics 15 to 18. The final will be
comprehensive and may include questions from Topics 19 to 21 if time
permits.
