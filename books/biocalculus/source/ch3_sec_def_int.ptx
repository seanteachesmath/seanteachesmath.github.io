<p> We introduce a new type of integral problem with
powerful applications.

<title>Position from velocity</title>

<p>	Recall the formula of your velocity function
<me>v(t) =</me> From this function we used the relationship that
<m>\displaystyle \frac{dp}{dt} = v(t)</m> to compute our position
function <m>p(t)</m>.

<p> Suppose you walk from class to class with this
velocity and it takes you 50 seconds to walk from one class to the next,
how many meters have you walked? Plot the velocity function to find out.

<p> Consider that your velocity for a brief period
of time is described by a quadratic function <me>v(t) = t^{2}</me> as
you
accelerate from a red light where your initial velocity is zero.

<p><ul>
<li> <p> We try to fill the space, from left to right,
under the graph with rectangles whose widths are known and whose heights
are related to the height of the graph at some point.</p> </li>
<li> <p> We take advantage of the fact that the area of a
rectangle by multiplying its width and height.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Given the area of a collection of rectangles, we
can add the areas of the rectangles to get an approximation to the
original area.</p> </li>

<p> Draw <m>n=5</m> <sq>left-hand</sq> rectangles to
approximate the area under the curve. Heights can be estimated from the
graph or calculated using the corresponding function value.
<me>\begin{aligned}
\left(\substack{\text{area}\\\text{under}\\\text{curve}}\right)
&amp;\approx \text{sum of the area of the rectangles}\\
&amp;= R_{1}+ R_2 + R_3 + R_4 + R_5\\
&amp;= w_{1}h_{1} + w_2h_2+ w_3h_3+ w_4h_4+ w_5h_5\\

+(0.2)(0.8^{2})\\

<p> Repeat the exercise above using the same number
of <sq>right-hand</sq> rectangles.

<p> For the function <m>f(t) = t^{2}</m>, consider the
following examples of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums used to
approximate the value of the definite integral, whose exact value will
be calculated very soon.

<p> The result of computing a definite integral is a
number, representing the area under a curve (or between the curve and
the horizontal axis). In particular, <me>\boxed{\int_a^b f(t)\,dt =
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\Big(\text{area of $n$ rectangles}\Big)}</me>
read <q>the integral from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> of <m>f(t)</m> with
respect to <m>t</m>.</q><!-- linebreak -->This is the <term>Riemann
integral</term> or <term>definite integral</term> defined to be the area
of <m>n</m> rectangles that collectively approximate the area under the
curve as <m>n\rightarrow\infty</m>.

are doing now and how it differs from what we have done before.

<p> For any continuous function <m>f(x)</m> and any
indefinite integral <m>\displaystyle F(x) = \int
f(x)\,dx</m>,<me>\boxed{\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(x)\Big|_a^b =
F(b)-F(a)}</me>
</p>

<p> The value of <m>\displaystyle \int_{0}^1
t^{2}\,dt</m>, which gives the area under the curve <m>f(t)  = t^{2}</m>
between <m>t=0</m> and <m>t=1</m> can be calculated using the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Since the integrand <m>t^{2}</m> is
continuous on the interval from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=1</m> we find
<me>\int_{0}^1 t^{2}\,dt
=\left.\left(\frac{t^{3}}{3}\right)\right|_{0}^1 =
\frac{1^{3}}{3} - \frac{0^{3}}{3} = \frac{1}{3}</me> which compares
favorably with our earlier estimates.
</p>

<p> Compute the following definite integrals.
</p>

<p> <m>\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2} t^{2}\,dt</m>
</p>

<p> <m>\displaystyle \int_2^6 \sqrt{x}\,dx</m>

<p> <m>\displaystyle \int_{10}^{12} 2t\,dt</m>
</p>

<p> <m>\displaystyle \int_{1}^{2} \frac{1}{x}\,dx</m>
</p>

<p> Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on the
interval from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>, and that <m>a\le c\le b</m>. Then
<me>\boxed{\displaystyle\int_a^b f(x) \, dx= \int_a^c f(x) \, dx
+\int_c^b f(x) \, dx}</me> i.e. the total change between times <m>a</m>
and <m>b</m> is the change between <m>a</m> and some intermediate time
<m>c</m> plus the change between time <m>c</m> and the final time
<m>b</m>.

<p> Suppose our female Atlantic sturgeon continues
to obey the equation <me>\frac{dL}{dt} = 19.56e^{-0.074t}</me> that
