<title>The Plan</title>

<p> We will introduce the basic ideas of mathematical
modeling and highlight concepts important to theoretical and empirical
research.

<title>What role does mathematics have in the biological
(and physical) sciences?</title>

<p>	Or, where have you encountered <sq>math</sq> in
class or research?

<title>Mathematics as a language</title>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> We have plenty of ways of understanding and
describing our natural and physical world. We have names for levels of
biological organization, names for molecules, notation for reactions,
and so on.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Similar to the rules of written languages, the
symbols and rules of mathematics can help express certain ideas and
facts, and even relationships between multiple interacting
quantities.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Until reaching calculus (and beyond), we have a
relatively limited vocabulary and set of rules to work with when
describing complicated situations.</p> </li>
<li> <p> In particular, it takes calculus to be able to
clearly and compactly describe certain concepts relating to
<sq>change</sq> and <sq>amount</sq>.</p> </li>

<title>Basic motivation</title>

<p> Two observations:
<ul>
<li> <p> Observing, describing, and understanding how
things change is the critical and interesting part of the biological
(and physical) sciences.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Calculus is the mathematical study of change.</p> </li>

</ul></p>

<title>Applied mathematics</title>

<p> Using mathematical theory, notation, methods,
and tools to answer general scientific questions (biology, chemistry,
physics, geology, …)
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> <p> make a measurement</p> </li>
<li> <p> describe how the measurement changes</p> </li>
<li> <p> develop a model – translate from the languages
of science (words, diagrams, descriptions) to math (symbols and
equations)</p> </li>
<li> <p> find solution using mathematical methods and
make predictions about the original problem</p> </li>

<p> Special branch of applied mathematics focused on
biological dynamics.

<title>Abstraction</title>

<p> One (of many) important skills to succeed in
this class and beyond is abstraction. This is
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> the realization that the letter <m>x</m> in an
equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the height of a
tree, the size of a population, the age of an animal</p> </li>
<li> <p> the understanding that although we are
interested in a specific biological problem, we have to carefully apply
the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution – we solve an equation
the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or
represents a real-world problem</p> </li>
<li> <p> the recognition that many visibly different
biological dynamics might be linked by <em>the same</em> mathematical
description, and that what we learn from one system could teach us about
another – even though we might not recognize any direct biological
similarities between the two systems</p> </li>
