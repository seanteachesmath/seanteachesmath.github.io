<p> We will learn and practice direct methods for computing
derivatives of functions defined by products or quotients of terms.

<title>Common products and ratios in science</title>

<p>	List a few common measurements that are defined as
products or quotients based on other measurements.
</p>

<p>	Suppose <m>p(x)=F(x)S(x)</m> where the
<sq>first</sq> function <m>F</m> and the <sq>second</sq> function
<m>S</m> are both differentiable. Then
</p>

<p>	Given the product <m>p(x)=(x-3)(x+2)</m>, find
<m>p'(x)</m>.
</p>

<p>	Find the derivative of <m>f(x)=\displaystyle
(3e^x+3x+7)(2x^{2}+e^{3x})</m>
</p>

<p>	Suppose <m>w(x)=\displaystyle\frac{T(x)}{B(x)}</m>,
where the <sq>top</sq> function <m>T(x)</m> and the <sq>bottom</sq>
function <m>B(x)</m> are differentiable and <m>B(x)\ne 0</m>. Then
</p>

<p>	Find the derivative of
<m>f(x)=\displaystyle\frac{x^{2}+3x+7}{2x^{2}}</m>
</p>

<p>	Find the derivative of
<m>f(x)=\displaystyle\frac{3e^x+3x+7}{2x^{2}+e^{3x}}</m>
</p>

<p>	The mass <m>M(t)</m> (in grams) of a fruit is given
by the product of its density <m>\rho(t)</m> (in grams per cubic cm) and
its volume <m>V(t)</m> (cubic cm), <me>M(t) = \rho(t)V(t).</me> Assume
that the density is decreasing according to <m>\rho(t) = 1-0.1t</m>, but
the volume grows according to <m>V(t) = 10+12t</m>. Since <m>\rho(t)</m>
decreases (a line with a negative slope) and <m>V(t)</m> increases, is
it obvious how <m>M(t)</m> should behave?
</p>

<p><ol>
<li><p>	Find the instantaneous rate of change at any time
<m>t</m> (the derivative) of <m>M(t)</m>, called <m>M'(t)</m>.</p> </li>

<li><p>	Is the mass initially increasing or decreasing as a
function of time?</p> </li>

<li><p>	At what time does <m>M(t)</m> change behavior?</p> </li>

</ol></p>

<p>	Hill functions are an important family of functions
used to describe biological response to a stimulus. They were first used
in 1919 (by Archibald Hill) to study and describe the cooperative
binding kinetics of oxygen to hemoglobin molecules. They are defined as
<me>h(x)=\displaystyle\frac{x^n}{1+x^n}, \quad n&gt;0</me> Find the
derivative of the Hill function with <m>n=2</m>.
</p>

<p>	For the function above compute leading behaviors at
zero and infinity, as well as limits at zero and infinity.
</p>

<p>	The number of molecules <m>n(t)</m> in a solution is
the concentration of molecules <m>c(t)</m> times the volume of the
solution <m>v(t)</m>: <me>n(t)=c(t)v(t).</me> Assume the concentration
decreases, <m>c(t)=4-t^{2}</m>, and the volume increases,
<m>v(t)=1+3t</m>.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li><p>	Is the total number of molecules initially
increasing or decreasing?</p> </li>

<li><p>	At what time does <m>n(t)</m> change behavior?</p> </li>

</ol></p>

<p>	Consider a population of mice that obeys the
equation <m>N(t)=1+2t+t^{2}</m>. The number of mice with hantavirus is
described by <m>I(t)=3t</m>, (<m>t</m> in months). The prevalence of
hantavirus in the population is defined as
<me>p(t)=\displaystyle\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}</me> How does the prevalence of
hantavirus in the population change with time?
</p>

<p>	For the functions above (that is <m>I(t)</m>,
<m>N(t)</m>, and <m>p(t)</m>) compute leading behaviors at zero and
infinity, as well as limits at zero and infinity. What is surprising
about the results of <m>\displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} p(t)</m> and
<m>\displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} I(t)</m>?

<title>Quick practice</title>

<exercise><statement> <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x) =
xe^x</m>?</p> </statement>
<solution><p> According to the product rule, the derivative of <m>f(x)
= xe^x</m> is <m>f'(x) = x(e^x)+e^x(1) = e^x(x+1)</m>. Here it might be
helpful to notice that we an factor out the term <m>e^x</m>.</p>

<exercise><statement> <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x) =
\dfrac{x}{e^{x}}</m>?</p> </statement>
<solution><p> According to the quotient rule, the derivative of
<m>f(x) = \dfrac{x}{e^x}</m> is <me>f'(x) = \dfrac{e^x(1)-
x(e^x)}{\left(e^x\right)^{2}} = \dfrac{\cancel{e^x}(1-
x)}{\left(e^x\right)^{\cancel{2}}} = \dfrac{(1- x)}{e^x}</me></p>
