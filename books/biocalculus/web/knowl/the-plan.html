<li><div class="para">We have plenty of ways of understanding and describing our natural and physical world. We have names for levels of biological organization, names for molecules, notation for reactions, and so on.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Similar to the rules of written languages, the symbols and rules of mathematics can help express certain ideas and facts, and even relationships between multiple interacting quantities.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Until reaching calculus (and beyond), we have a relatively limited vocabulary and set of rules to work with when describing complicated situations.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In particular, it takes calculus to be able to clearly and compactly describe certain concepts relating to ‘change’ and ‘amount’.</div></li>
