<p>We look at a few applications of the definite integral.</p>
<p>Given that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> are continuous and that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> on the interval from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{,}\)</span> the area between the curves <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b \left(f(x) -
g(x)\right)\,dx

<p>‘Degree-days’ are used as a way to measure growth and development in plants and other temperature-dependent species, such as insects.</p>
<p>Find the area between the curves <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^{3}\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The average value for a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> on the interval from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}

<p>An oil company describes the rate of change in consumption of oil resources (in billions of barrels) using the equation <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{dc}{dt} = 1.2e^{0.04t}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> indicating the year 1998.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Using a definite integral, compute the total resource consumption over the first ten years since 1998.<em class="emphasis">Note: Be sure to transform the limits of integration if you use <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution!</em></p></li>
<li><p>What is the average rate of consumption over the period?</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat these two steps for the next ten years, the period from 2008 to 2018.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In 1998, the above company estimated 30 billion barrels in the reserve. Compute the definite integral that gives the total consumption over the first <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> years since 1998,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^T\,1.2e^{0.04t}\,dt,

<p class="continuation">and use the resulting formula to find how many years it will take for the 30 billion barrel supply to be exhausted. <em class="emphasis">Note: Set the result of the definite integral equal to 30 and solve for <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span></em></p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Justification – average value formula.</span></h4>
<p>Consider the following situation as a brief justification for the average value formula quoted above.</p>
<p>During an experiment to test the effects of a dietary supplement on growth of quail, a researcher takes weekly measurements of the mass of a bird in ounces.</p>

<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">A problem.</span></h5>
<p>The mass of the animal varies continuously with time according to some function <span class="process-math">\(m(t)\text{.}\)</span> What if we were to choose different times for our measurement? How would our average mass change? What other methods might we have to compute the average mass over an <dfn class="terminology">interval</dfn>?</p>
<p>Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(m(t) = -t^{2}+6t + 6\)</span> that describes the mass of the quail during the growth experiment. Use the definite integral to calculate the average mass of the bird during the study? How does this compare to your earlier results?</p></section></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="applications-of-the-definite-integral.html#the-plan-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
