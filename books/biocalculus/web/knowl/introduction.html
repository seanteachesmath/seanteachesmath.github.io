<p>Change, key to science (and calculus), is conveyed by the . When we talk about change it is helpful to note,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\Delta\)</span> is mathematical shorthand for change in a variable:<span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> typically means change in time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span><span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> typically means change in variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and so on</p></li>
<li><p>we often talk about rates of change</p></li>

</ul></section><section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Lines, secant lines, and rates of change.</span></h4>
<p>When talking about the average rate of change of a measurement we compute the ratio of change in output over change in input (often time). This ratio is also the slope of a line that we call the secant line.</p>
<p>The secant line connects two points that lie on the graph of a function. We call one of the points the <dfn class="terminology">base point</dfn>.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">When we pick our two points on a graph, we are still computing the slope of a line through these points (even though it has a new name – the secant line).</em></p>
