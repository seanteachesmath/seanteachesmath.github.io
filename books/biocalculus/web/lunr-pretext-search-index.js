  "body": " Users guide  Welcome to what I hope is a fun, challenging, and rewarding class. This packet of notes and a scientific calculator are really the only things you should need for this class this semester. Each day we’ll work through a few pages together in class.  Occasionally I will pass out supplemental notes when something relevant hits the news or post notes online if we skip an example in the interest of time. With a three-hole punch, you should easily be able to add to these notes.  With the exception of a few Quick Problems at the end of each section, the one thing you should notice that is missing from this packet is anything that resembles homework. The Quick Problems and included answers are merely for your practice and will not be collected. Most homework for this class will be posted and submitted using a free online homework system. Occasionally I will have you hand in written problems with graphs or explanations.  While it might seem a bit wasteful, I have probably printed the associated notes one-sided to give you additional space for writing, drawing, or scratch work.  Our first test covers Topics 1 to 7, our second test covers Topics 8 to 14, our third test covers Topics 15 to 18. The final will be comprehensive and may include questions from Topics 19 to 21 if time permits.  "

  "body": " What is bio-calculus?   The Plan  We will introduce the basic ideas of mathematical modeling and highlight concepts important to theoretical and empirical research.   What role does mathematics have in the biological (and physical) sciences?  Or, where have you encountered math in class or research?   Mathematics as a language    We have plenty of ways of understanding and describing our natural and physical world. We have names for levels of biological organization, names for molecules, notation for reactions, and so on.    Similar to the rules of written languages, the symbols and rules of mathematics can help express certain ideas and facts, and even relationships between multiple interacting quantities.    Until reaching calculus (and beyond), we have a relatively limited vocabulary and set of rules to work with when describing complicated situations.    In particular, it takes calculus to be able to clearly and compactly describe certain concepts relating to change and amount .      Basic motivation  Two observations:   Observing, describing, and understanding how things change is the critical and interesting part of the biological (and physical) sciences.    Calculus is the mathematical study of change.      Applied mathematics  Using mathematical theory, notation, methods, and tools to answer general scientific questions (biology, chemistry, physics, geology, …)    make a measurement    describe how the measurement changes    develop a model – translate from the languages of science (words, diagrams, descriptions) to math (symbols and equations)    find solution using mathematical methods and make predictions about the original problem      Mathematical biology  Special branch of applied mathematics focused on biological dynamics.    Abstraction  One (of many) important skills to succeed in this class and beyond is abstraction. This is    the realization that the letter in an equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the height of a tree, the size of a population, the age of an animal    the understanding that although we are interested in a specific biological problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution – we solve an equation the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world problem    the recognition that many visibly different biological dynamics might be linked by the same mathematical description, and that what we learn from one system could teach us about another – even though we might not recognize any direct biological similarities between the two systems       "

Problem\/Topic:  (Pick a topic.)   Question:  (What do you hope to answer?)    Measurements:  (What do you plan to measure?) Dependent variable:   a symbol for measurement of interest that changes during course of an experiment and whose change depends on the value of some other measurements   Dependent variable (example):    Independent variable:   a symbol for measurement that also changes during course of an experiment, but which does so independently of all other measurements   Independent variable (example):     Conditions:  (What do you plan to control?) Parameters:   conceptually, a symbol or symbols representing the effect of measurement(s) or condition(s) that are constant for any one trial of an experiment, but that vary between trials mathematically, all constants (either symbols or numerical values) in a formula that are not variables   Parameters (example):     Dimensions and Units:  (What kind of measurements did you take?) Dimensions:   a key feature or fundamental aspect of a type of measurement   Dimensions (examples):    Units:   a particular standard of measurement for a given dimension   Units (examples):     Results:  (How would you describe and display your findings?)    Graph (features):     Blank paper for sketching hypothesized experimental results.     Functions:  (How can we represent our results using mathematics?)     Thinking about graphs  Given our experiment, how else might we have graphed the results?    Graph:     image    Observations:   To make the most of our experiment, it is best to show all of our data simultaneously. Here we can more carefully examine the roles of the variables and parameters and the graphical and mathematical connections.    Graph:     image    Observations:     Developing your own experiment  In your groups, discuss the Problem, Question, Measurements, Conditions, Dimensions and Units, and potential Results of your experiment.    Concept of a function:  Functions give us a compact way to describe how one measurement (the output ) depends on another (the input ):    Describing a function:  We can describe functions in four ways:    in words    in a graph    as data (a table)    as a formula      Combining functions:  We can combine functions by    addition and subtraction    multiplication or division (if the denominator is nonzero)    composition    Consider two functions and .    adding and subtracting: plus\/minus of                   multiplying and dividing: multiplied\/divided by of                   composition: : of of or of of             Are and the same?        Note (composition of functions)  Consider two functions and . In the composition , is the inner function and is the outer function. Here, is applied to first, then is applied to the result.  Consider the following composed functions. For each identify the pair of inner and outer functions involved in defining the composition.     is composition of functions , define the functions and .     is composition of functions , define the functions and .     is composition of functions , define the functions and .      Inverse functions  Functions allow us to compute output for a given input. Sometimes it is useful to know from which input we arrived a particular output. We can use output to find the input by using the inverse of a function. In general, we would write that the function is the inverse of , meaning We will make use of this when solving a variety of equations involving exponential functions.      Quick practice  You measure cytotoxicity of three different concentrations of a cancer drug over time. Identify the variables and parameters.  DV : cytoxicity (number of cells killed), IV : time (probably in hours), parameter : the concentration as varied between trials.   How would you graph the results obtained in Question ?  It would be interesting to see cytotoxicity (number of cells killed) plotted against time with sets of points or curves colored by the drug concentration used.   Simplify .  We need a common denominator to add, so .   For evaluate , , and .  For the values are    ,     , and     .

  "body": " Dimensions and units   The Plan  Dimensions and units are critical to our ability to collect data, make valid quantitative and even qualitative comparisons, and draw conclusions.   Measurements have units (e.g., cm, pounds, liters)  We use identities to move between units and we use fundamental relations (e.g., geometry formulas) to move between dimensions.   Facts  To compare quantities we need a common unit, we convert to a common unit, or we give up.    Two sides of an equation must have identical units.    Two terms added together must have identical units.    Two terms multiplied\/divided are allowed to have different units.    To convert between units, multiply by identities (e.g., 1 yd = 3 ft) to cancel unwanted units and obtain desired units.   How many millimeters are in 1 foot?  How can we calculate areas from lengths?  How many square millimeters are in 1 square foot?  Which is bigger or ?    Volumes, areas, and other amounts  Instead of identities, use fundamental relations (e.g., geometry formulas) to convert between measurements with different dimensions.  A flat, circular colony of yeast has diameter of 1.2 mm. What is the area of the colony?    Keeping track of units on functions  When appropriate we want to make good use of the benefits of function notation and function manipulation, while preserving the unit of the underlying measurement. In particular, we want to be able to use given information to determine when we are evaluating a function (units of the input) or solving an equation (units of the output).  Consider two mathematical functions used to represent the change in these quantities, and .    What are dimensions and sensible units for each?    How can we combine these functions (measurements) to define other realistic measurements?      Take-away messages    Dimensional analysis – Always check to make sure dimensions match on each side of the equals sign!    Functions describe relations between measurements, so inputs and outputs have units and dimensions.    Only compose functions when their units and dimensions match.

  "body": " Linear functions and their graphs   The Plan  Linear functions are the basis for most relationships that we can think about.    linear function  A relationship defined by    , with constants and , or     , with constant and a point   is called a linear function between the variables  and . If the formula involves only adding and subtracting constants with variables multiplied by constants, the equation describes a linear function.    The slope of a linear function passing through two points and is defined as the ratio of the change in output over the change in input ( rise over run ),   Notation  In general, in biological applications we rarely have inputs\/outputs called and – for example we have mass and volume. These labels, while different from what we are used to are meant to make problems more meaningful!     Here we will derive a common (and commonly mis-remembered) temperature formula.   Recall: What is the formula for computing the temperature in F if you know temperature in C?   Data: Consider the following data:       C  F    0  32    20  68    37  98.6    100  212      Graph it: Plot the points to determine whether a linear function holds.   Slope: Identify a pair of points and compute the slope.   Linear functions: Now write , first in point-slope form, then simplify to slope-intercept form.     Sample pgfplots plot   A pgfplots example, with a function, a parametric curve, and some points plotted.       Notice that the definition gives us all we need to derive both point-slope form and slope-intercept form. Let our point be and instead of , choose to be any other point on the line.    Once again rewrite this as slope-intercept form.   How are point-slope and slope-intercept forms related?     Which of the following are linear functions?                  Interpolation  Frequently we use linear functions to interpolate or predict values occurring between two known values. This technique is called linear interpolation, and is illustrated in the following example.     Here we look at the onset of AIDS symptoms in the years after initial HIV infection. Four years after infection 17% had symptoms, and seven years after infection 33% had symptoms.   Write the formula for a linear function that relates the percent of patients with AIDS symptoms to time (years measured since infection).    Define and interpret the slope and intercept (units included).    How many patients (what percent) have symptoms after five and a half years?    Using this model, at what time would you predict that half of all exposed patients have AIDS symptoms? What must you do to answer this question?       Important facts about linear functions  The following work should help us reason through linear functions (and eventually many more).    Example    Behavior    Slope     A proportional relation is a linear relation in which the output is proportional to input. In general     A fundamental relation , links mass measured in and volume measured in .    Is this fundamental relation a proportional relation?    What are the units on each term?    What is the mass of an object with volume ?    Is the formula for temperature conversion a proportional relation?    What is constant?    the ratio of output over input proportional relation:    the ratio of change in output over change in input linear function: (i.e., slope is constant)      Quick practice   In Question of the previous section, we talked about the relationship between area and radius. Is that relationship linear? Why or why not? In Question of the previous section, we talked about the relationship between area and radius, . This is not linear, since we must square the radius to get the area.   In Question of the previous section, we talked about the relationship between radius and diameter. Is that relationship linear? Why or why not? In Question of the previous section, we talked about the relationship between radius and diameter. This is linear since , in fact this is proportional since the radius is a constant multiple of the diameter. This is a good reminder that dividing by two is the same as multiplying by one half.   (This one might not be so quick practice.) In chemistry we use the Lineweaver-Burk or double-reciprocal plot to determine properties of a chemical reaction. We graph a surprisingly complicated looking, but still linear, relationship where is the reaction rate or velocity , is the substrate concentration, and and are parameters in the relationship between our original variables and .

A population maintains a factor of of its variability each generation. How much variability is left after 5 generations?  We have a shortcut for evaluating values like this.

Prediction  An important part of mathematics and science is describing the mechanisms by which measurements change and making a testable prediction.   Approach: Discrete-time dynamical systems  Used to predict measurements made at discrete time intervals (e.g., measurements made once per hour, day, week). Consider a measurement made at time , to define a discrete-time dynamical system (DTDS) we write     Yeast growth  Recall the data collected earlier this semester, similar to what is presented below, that describe the growth of yeast from one day to the next.    image   From the graph, predict the final area of your colony if you initially measured an area of 100 mm ?  From the graph, predict the final area of your colony if you initially measured an area of 10 mm ?  Mathematically what are you doing to make your prediction?  Let denote the measured area (mm ) of the yeast measured on day . Define the DTDS that predicts the future measurement, called .     Definition – solution  The sequence of values for is the solution of the discrete-time dynamical system starting from initial condition . We sometimes graph the solution as a plot of points against time.  For our yeast growth predictions, example initial conditions above were mm and mm . Using the updating function, compute five terms of the solution starting from each of these initial conditions.   Starting from mm   Starting from mm     A solution formula  Sometimes we can write a formula for the solution to predict the population size at any future time .    A graphical computer  We have a powerful technique for studying the behavior of such models using only a pencil and paper. This technique is called cobwebbing, and its name will be come clear shortly.    image   Note: you often will not have the data points on this graph, so they have been removed. This is how we cobweb :    Graph the updating function and the diagonal (the identity or line )    Start at initial condition and go up or down to the updating function and over to the diagonal    Repeat for as many steps as needed to find the pattern    Sketch the solution at times      Updating and inverses  What could we learn from the inverse of the updating function to the DTDS     Extra DTDS examples  The following completely nonbiological examples illustrate some interesting mathematical behaviors. These will help us understand behaviors of more complicated biological models next time.      Cobwebbing diagrams for some linear discrete-time dynamical systems. These are not themselves biologically interesting, but emphasize the technique and have subtle connections to important applications.   Each day a patient uses up half of the medication in his bloodstream, but he is also given a new dose that raises the concentration in the blood stream by 1 mg\/L. Let denote the concentration on day .    Write a DTDS describing this situation and plot the updating function.    What does the solution look like if you start with = 5 mg\/L? = 1 mg\/L?    Plot the diagonal and updating function for the previous model and cobweb five terms of the solution starting from = 5 mg\/L and then from = 1 mg\/L.    Blank graph paper for DTDS.   What happens if you start at ?  A point is called an equilibrium of the DTDS if (i.e., if updating by the DTDS leaves the input unchanged).    Find equilibria (more than 1 equilibrium) graphically by locating the points where the graphs of the updating function and diagonal intersect.    Find equilibria algebraically by setting and solving for .    Compute equilibrium values for the following DTDS.

  "body": " Introduction to limits   The Plan  The next topic, limits of functions, is almost a purely mathematical topic, but one we will soon use to develop one of the central concepts of calculus. Imagine yourself working in the lab, about to undertake an exciting experiment. Before you can dive in, you must first orient yourself with your equipment, calibrate it, and practice a few basic techniques. Think of this topic, limits  Limits are undoubtedly important throughout mathematics and fill a whole chapter of a typical calculus course. They are central for many topics in advanced mathematics, but we will take just a brief look into limits. , as an orientation to an important piece of machinery.    Limits  In addition to eventually allowing us to compute instantaneous rates of change (derivatives) of mathematical functions, we use limits to study and describe behavior of functions.   Concept of a limit  For a function and two numbers and , the statement means that the value of gets closer and closer to as gets closer and closer to . Sometimes we say more simply that the value of approaches as approaches . This helps us explain and compute what does near a point  even if is undefined !    A sketch to motivate the idea of limits.     One– and two–sided limits  Some functions have complicated domains and we can only discuss what happens as approaches from one side. We say one of the following:     Talking about limits, a tool for mathematical precision, requires precision in our approach.   Consider the appropriate one–sided and two–sided limits for the following functions.    image        image        image       Limits of basic functions  Consider limits of the following two basic functions.   Suppose , where is a constant, for all . Then for any value of  or, in words the limit of a constant function is that value of that constant as approaches any value .    Suppose for all . Then for any value of  or, in words values of the the function approach as the variable approaches .       Consider the appropriate one–sided and two–sided limits for the following functions.   Limits at ,   Limits at a negative value,   Limits at a positive value,     image   Limits at ,   Limits at a negative value,   Limits at a positive value,     image   Limits at ,   Limits at a negative value,   Limits at a positive value,   Notice that the only (two-sided) limit to not exist is the one that corresponds to the most complicated of the three graphs in its most complicated portion (left panel: near ). This is because the one-sided limits of the function do not match as approaches from the left and right. In all other cases we are looking at graphs that look more familiar (no jumps, no open or filled points) at the points we are evaluating the limits. Also notice that    we can say things like which refers to our attempt to approach the value of  from the right hand side.    the superscript has nothing to do with the sign of the number itself, only the direction from which we approach the number.    We will spend most of our time looking at two-sided limits once we get an understanding of some important categories of functions.   limits of combinations of functions  Suppose and are functions with well-defined limits at .   The limit of the sum is the sum of the limits    The limit of the product is the product of the limits    The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the function    Provided , the limit of the quotient (or ratio) is the quotient (or ratio) of the limits        Polynomials  Since a polynomial (e.g., a quadratic or a cubic function) is the sum of terms that involve variables (like ) to powers (like ) multiplied by constants (like ), we could decompose limits of polynomials using  and evaluate them with  .    Reducing formulas to basic functions   Write the following functions using only constant and identity functions:                            Limits using basic functions   Use Theorem  to evaluate the limits of and from the previous example.     We can now evaluate limits of polynomials by direct substitution.               Division by zero   When studying a function such as , we must be aware that the function is undefined at . When talking about the limits,    image       x         -1     -0.1     -0.001     -0.0001     0  Ahh! No!        0.0001     0.001     0.1     1      To finally assign values to these limits,      Division by zero   What about our approach changes if we consider limits of ?       Square roots  Since the input of the square root function must be positive, we talk about only the one–sided limit since we can only approach from above (the right side of the number line). Fortunately for us, square root functions do not show up a great deal in biological applications.      Quick practice   Compute .   Since the limit of a constant function is the value of that constant, .    Compute .   By applying the rules of computing limits .    Compute the limits  ,  , and  .

By studying a particular category of functions – the continuous functions – we can introduce a faster computational method for finding the value of a limit of a function at a point.   Intuitive definition of a continuous function  We tend to think of functions as being continuous if we can draw the corresponding graph without lifting our pencil (you should probably be graphing in pencil).   Jumps, and holes, and asymptotes  There are three major ways that a function can fail to be continuous, that is, for it to encounter an input value, but fail to produce an output:    image     image     image   A function is continuous at a point  if Otherwise, we say is discontinuous at point .  A function is continuous if it is continuous at all points in its domain (i.e., at each point it takes on the value that it should according to the value of its limit).    Important consequence!  If we are talking about the limit of a continuous function at a point in its domain we can compute the limit by evaluating the function at the point we are taking the limit. This is helpful for many limits.  Find the limit of as .    Basic continuous functions  There are five basic continuous functions from which others are built. We will focus on the first four in this class.      image      image     image      Making new continuous functions  Given two continuous functions and at our hope is to build other continuous functions. To do so, we can    add them is continuous at    multiply them is continuous at    divide them is continuous at , provided that    compose them is continuous at , provided that is continuous at    Let’s use the graphs of our basic continuous functions to build a few more complicated (but still continuous) functions.      Quick practice   Is the function continuous?   The function is continuous, it is the constant function.    Is the function continuous?  The function is continuous, it is a linear function.    Is the function continuous?  The function is not continuous, since it is undefined for . The limit there does not exist, so it could not possibly match the value of the function, , which incidentally is undefined.    "

  "body": " Limits and behaviors at infinity   The Plan  We will look at a powerful method for studying and describing the long-term values and behaviors of functions. This will give us a powerful, compact notation for making precise descriptions.    Limits and long-term behavior  Rather than talking about limits at a finite input, we now focus on limits as inputs become infinitely large In the long run (or ), functions can have only a few qualitatively different behaviors that describe how they approach their limiting value.   Real-world example from research  A neuroscientist interested in the response of muscle fibers to stress measures the firing rate of a stretched (and stressed) muscle fiber through time. She presented the following data:     Motivating data from a muscle fiber stretch response experiment.   If this was your data, what function would you use to describe it?  After quite a while, what value would the firing rate likely approach?    Expanding our library of functions  So far we have focused on polynomials (lines, quadratics, cubics, and so on), exponential and logarithmic functions, and sums, products, ratios. and compositions build from these. To better understand these functions and few new ones, we compare their behaviors for large inputs.    Functions approaching , ordered by speed  Below we consider constants to help build larger categories of functions.       Function  Features                 Sketches of these functions:  Suppose      approaches infinity (or ) faster than  if Ex.     approaches infinity (or ) slower than  if Ex.     approaches infinity (or ) at the same rate as if Ex.      Functions approaching 0, ordered by speed  Below we consider constants to help build larger categories of functions.

Summary of behaviors as  The following plots illustrate the basic shapes of functions that are important when discussing their limits at infinity.    Comparison of a few functions that share the characteristic of approaching infinity as .

Function  Family  Features                     Recall the earlier example of the stretch response of muscle fibers. Below we show a computer-generated best fit to the data and illustrate important biological and statistical differences of the speeds of functions.   Data fit by the sum of a constant and an exponential function,     A less than ideal fit of a mathematical function to muscle fiber stretch response data.    Description:   Data fit by the sum of a constant and the composition of a power function with exponential function,     A very good fit of a mathematical function to muscle fiber stretch response data.    Description:   In ecology we use these functions to describe the numerical response of predators to prey or of harvesters to their crop. In chemistry we use these functions to describe rates for reaction kinetics, for example, Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. Forms generally have the following features,   Linear   Saturating   Saturating (with threshold)   Overcompensation     Leading behavior  The often useful method of leading behavior helps us approximate complicated functions by their most dominant terms. This tells us what the graph of a complicated function looks like .  The leading behavior of a function at , written , is the term that is largest as the input approaches .     Find for    Find for .    The leading behavior of a function at 0, written , is the term that is largest as the input approaches 0.

Limit of a ratio is the ratio of limit, when limits are finite values.    Earlier rules for limits fail when limits are infinite; we cannot do the arithmetic with infinities.    We can use reasoning about relative speeds of different terms or need more advanced techniques.      Important facts  A function and its leading behavior approach at the same rate, or Also the leading behavior of a function defined by a ratio, such as is defined as the ratio of the leading behaviors or   We illustrate this method by example using the function , one example of functional form from earlier.

Change  Change, key to science (and calculus), is conveyed by the . When we talk about change it is helpful to note,   is mathematical shorthand for change in a variable: typically means change in time , typically means change in variable , and so on   we often talk about rates of change     Rates of change   Consider a bacteria population measured as a function of time , we can describe two kinds of change      average rate of change:    instantaneous rate of change: (We will come back to this in the next section.)    Rates of change have units! There should be more than one correct answer for each option.    What two quantities are changing if we describe average velocity?    What are the units of the rate of change of size of a tree?    What are the units of the rate of change that describes how an infectious disease spreads?      Lines, secant lines, and rates of change  When talking about the average rate of change of a measurement we compute the ratio of change in output over change in input (often time). This ratio is also the slope of a line that we call the secant line.  The secant line connects two points that lie on the graph of a function. We call one of the points the base point .   When we pick our two points on a graph, we are still computing the slope of a line through these points (even though it has a new name – the secant line).

If we say a function is differentiable without mentioning a particular point, we mean it is differentiable everywhere.    Problem behaviors  Functions fail to be differentiable at points on the graph with jumps, corners, and vertical tangents. See graphs from the earlier lecture as examples of discontinuities.   Find the derivative, if it exists, of at point  using the limit definition.  Find the derivative, if it exists, of the constant function  .

Power rule for derivatives   Suppose for integers (this allows to be negative or positive) This works for all powers including fractions, provided that .   Use the previous theorem to compute derivatives of the following power functions.    Higher derivatives  We will learn how to interpret some higher derivatives soon, but we can already differentiate quite a few functions. We’ll cover this soon, but you might as well try computing the second derivatives, as illustrated below. The mechanics are just the same. For problems involving exponentials and logarithms be sure to simplify as fully as possible first using log rules, otherwise we might not know what to do to compute the derivative!      Quick practice   What is the derivative of ?   The derivative of is . The derivative of a linear function is its slope.    Where is the critical point of given that ?

The position (height in meters from ground level) is described by find the velocity of the seed and its acceleration.  Continuing based on our work above,    At what time does the seed reach its greatest height?    What is the greatest height?    How long until the seed lands?      Critical points and second derivatives  For a function , a critical point is an -value at which the derivative is zero or not defined. Here we focus on the kind of critical point where .At such a point the function commonly experiences a change in behavior.     image     image     Derivatives and important points  Derivatives encode important information about functions.    critical points (where ) often indicate where a function changes behavior    inflection points (possible where ) indicate where a function changes shape (concavity)      Facts about derivatives   Recall the following facts about first and second derivatives.  Derivatives describe .      First derivative  Function             Second derivatives describe .

In general, an individual optimum value is called a local maximum or minimum. at a critical point if or is undefined. If the function has an optimum value, it is    a local maximum if the derivative switches from    a local minimum if the derivative switches from     There is no local optimum value if the derivative does not change sign.   The Second Derivative Test outlined below helps is find local optima at critical points :    If , then a local maximum value of occurs at and the function value is    If , then a local minimum value of occurs at and the function value is    If , then we have to look more closely at the sign of the first derivative     We have to know the locations of the critical points (from the first derivative) in order to apply the SDT!   Consider the functions and , their first and second derivatives, and their graphs. Find local optima for each function.  Mathematical functions of the form are important in statistics and modeling (fisheries models, for example). The graph is pictured below:    image   From the graph, describe the behavior and concavity.  Is there a maximum value that the function takes on? If so, where does this happen?  Mathematical functions of the form are used to model the growth rate of populations that can be described by logistic growth. Here the growth rate of the population is a function of the current size of the population. Find the local maximum growth rate of the population. At which size does it grow the fastest?  Consider , find critical points and use the SDT to find local optima (maxima and\/or minima). Using information about increasing, decreasing, concavity, and the locations of local extrema sketch the graph .  A global optimum value is guaranteed to exist for a function on an interval. The global maximum is the largest value that the function achieves, the global minimum is the smallest value that the function achieves. Global extrema occur at critical points or endpoints of the interval.   The steps are as follows:    Evaluate function at endpoints.    Find all critical points.    Compute the function value at critical points.    Largest is the global maximum, smallest is the global minimum.    Find global optima of the function on the interval  .    Biological and scientific applications  In general, we might want to optimize production of a chemical, yield or harvest of a plant or animal product, reproductive output, survival, growth rate.

  "body": " Applications to chemistry   The Plan  We continue our work on integration by introducing an application to autonomous differential equations via the integrated rate laws - a cornerstone of chemical kinetics.   Background  The integrated rate laws exist at the interface of calculus and chemistry. By studying these equations from a calculus perspective, the results are much more cohesive than it might first appear. Often \"we\" are interested in the change in concentration of a particular chemical species. Here let, To be consistent with class notation and objectives, we will use to refer to the concentration.   Zeroth order  Within this family, the first formula comes from the zeroth order reaction given by Since this contains , the right-hand side simplifies to the constant . At this point, we are looking for an unknown function whose derivative is the constant . Thinking about this from the perspective of differentiation, we are looking for a function whose derivative is a constant. This means that is linear and that constant, , is its slope. So, where is the constant of integration and gives the initial concentration of the reactant.        First order  Since the differential equation is , we can guess the solution by answering the question, \"what function has a derivative that is a constant times itself?\". Since , It turns out that multiplying by a constant we have     First order - revisited  Just like before, but now with a power of on the right-hand side, we have . Our goal will be to move all of the -like quantities to the left-hand side and leave any constants on the right-hand side. This turns out to give some evidence in support of a well-known technique in differential equations called separation of variables . We proceed as follows, first dividing by on each side, then integrating each side with respect to ,   This is somewhat abstract, but we can immediately apply -substitution. To do so, we have to recognize that the unknown function is and that . Now, this isn't immediately useful, but remembering our notation , so we can write, . Suddenly we are finished with our process of -substittution and can integrate. Continuing from above   Remembering above that we can return to our chemistry notation, that . What is left is to specify a value for . Thinking of our physical situation we have that (again as a chemist you might be picturing the quantity , but this bracket notation is somewhat unsatisfying mathematically). This gives , or . Since we expect , we can neglect the absolute value bars in favor of notational simplicity. This gives the zeroth-order integrated rate law , . Under these assumptions we expect the concentration of chemical species to decay linearly as a function of time with a slope of , beginning from an initial concentration of .  In this case, the plot of the natural logarithm of the observed concentration will resemble a decreasing linear function.  We may also be aware that a first-order reaction corresponds to exponential decay , in fact, exponentiating both sides of the formula above gives   Historically it was important to express data in terms of linear relationships, so a plot of the natural logarithm of a measurement that gave rise to a linear trend was a good indicator of this relationship and estimation of the slope was relatively easy. In contemporary times it is relatively easy to 'fit' nonlinear functions like exponentials, so it would be reasonable to plot the raw data, not its natural logarithm, and look the underlying exponential relationship and its parameter .    Second order  Just like before, but now with a power of on the right-hand side   Again the unknown function is and that . Now, this isn't immediately useful, but remembering our notation , so we can write, . Suddenly we are finished with our process of -substittution and can integrate. Continuing from above Using the initial condition, or   Solving for we have  The plot of the reciprocal of is an increasing linear function with a slope of .    Summary  Three very different looking formulas all result from integration of for different values of corresponding to the reaction order. Solving each for suggests that evolves very differently in each case.      Quick practice   "

Historical examples  We will discuss two famous DTDS from the scientific literature: the Ricker model and the discrete-logistic model.       This model was used to study changes in fish populations over a 4 year period (chosen based on the reproductive cycle of the fish). The updating function (the curve) was chosen based on fisheries data and modeling.    image      This model was used to study changes in empirical and theoretical populations. Two examples of the updating function (the curves) are illustrated.   Dynamics and stability  We see a hint of a stability condition in the right-hand panel. Recall that equilibria occur where the diagonal and updating functions cross. The equilibrium point is stable if the updating function is not too steep at this point, and unstable if the updating function is too steep at this point. What might we mean by too steep ? How can we describe the steepness of a graph at a point?    Sample solutions  Using the computer code as a guide, sketch some sample cobwebs.    image     image     Conclusions  From your computer experiments and analysis above what conclusions can you draw about this model and its solutions?

Near an equilibrium looks like its tangent line, whose slope is given by the derivative there, . Zooming in near the equilibrium point , the nonlinear model will look like one of the four cases pictured at the conclusion of the previous section with one of the basic behaviors.    Ricker Model  Originally published in the 1950’s, the Ricker model was used to describe change in size of fish populations from one measurement to the next. Though there are other variants presented in literature, the model is where the values and are parameters. This model has been used to    estimate growth and population parameters from data    predict population growth    optimize yields from harvested populations      Analysis of the Ricker DTDS  To get some basic information we will analyze the Ricker model by hand before moving onto computing.    With and , find the equilibria for the Ricker model.    What is if ?    What is ? Are equilibria stable? Should solutions oscillate?    Repeat the analysis if .      Discrete logistic  The famous model May discusses in the paper cited above is the discrete logistic equation or the logistic map, given by where and are parameters and we think of as describing the size of a biological population. The algebra of the analysis simplifies if we choose .    With and , find the equilibria for the discrete logistic model.    What is if if again ?    What is ? Are equilibria stable? Should solutions oscillate?    Repeat the analysis if .      Note on modeling  Both of these models, and many others, are of the form where is the per capita production as a function of the current population size. This model tells us that the new population size is a multiple of the old population size, and tells us what the multiple is. What is for each of the models above?     "

Autonomous differential equations  Differential equations are the backbone of the physical and natural sciences and mathematical modeling. So far we have used differentiation to study functions.      Measured   Computed    Position           Mass       Now we use knowledge of derivatives to write differential equations to describe changes in measurements.      Measured   Computed      Position      Mass      Population size      Amount of chemical     The state variable is the unknown quantity of interest.  An equation that describes how an unknown variable changes, and how the change depends on the value of the variable itself,    Functions and derivatives  Recall the relationship between a function and its first derivative:      Derivative  Function            positive     negative     zero      Our approach is to describe the derivative and find the function – opposite to our approach to this point.  Consider a population of bacteria that grows according to the equation . Derive an autonomous differential equation that describes population growth.  The differential equation we derived is given by .  The phase line is a plot of the rate of change against the value of the variable used to study and summarize dynamics.  An equilibrium point (solution) is a value of the state variable at which the rate of change is zero. Or, for the differential equation an equilibrium is found using the equation .    Phase line (exponential growth)  Reasoning about functions and derivatives helps us predict dynamics.  A model for the change in temperature of an object, like a solid mass or a container of liquid, is described by Newton’s Law of Cooling.    Phenomenon:    Mathematical Model:    Phase line diagram (from plot of rate of change in temperature vs. temperature):    A model for the change in population size of a single species is described by the logistic growth equation.
