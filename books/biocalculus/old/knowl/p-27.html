<p> One (of many) important skills to succeed in this class and beyond is <dfn class="terminology">abstraction</dfn>. This is</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>the realization that the letter \(x\) in an equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the height of a tree, the size of a population, the age of an animal</p></li>
<li><p>the understanding that although we are interested in a specific biological problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution -- we solve an equation the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world problem</p></li>
<li><p>the recognition that many visibly different biological dynamics might be linked by <em class="emphasis">the same</em> mathematical description, and that what we learn from one system could teach us about another -- even though we might not recognize any direct biological similarities between the two systems</p></li>
