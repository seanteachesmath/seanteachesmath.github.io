<p>This is often called \(u\)-substitution since we think of \(u\) as the name assigned to the inside function \(g(x)\) from the Chain Rule. To outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the variable \(x\text{,}\) though where you see an \(x\) below you can imagine another variable such as \(t\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Define a new variable, called \(u = g(x)\text{,}\) as some function of the old variable \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the differential \(du = g'(x) dx\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Put everything in the integral in terms of the new variable, \(u\text{.}\) (Replace the inside function by the letter u and replace what remains by the definition for \(du\text{.}\)) Sometimes we have to rearrange a bit here so that du fits back in the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to integrate in terms of the new variable, \(u\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>After integrating, try to put everything back in terms of the old variable \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
