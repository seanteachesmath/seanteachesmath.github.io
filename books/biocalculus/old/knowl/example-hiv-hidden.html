<body><article class="example example-like"> Here we look at the onset of AIDS symptoms in the years after initial HIV infection. Four years after infection \(17%\) had symptoms, and seven years after infection \(33\%\) had symptoms. <ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Write the formula for a linear function that relates the percent of patients with AIDS symptoms to time (years measured since infection).</p></li>
<li><p>Define and interpret the slope and intercept (units included).</p></li>
<li><p>How many patients (what percent) have symptoms after five and a half years?</p></li>
<li><p>Using this model, at what time would you predict that half of all exposed patients have AIDS symptoms? What must you do to answer this question?</p></li>
