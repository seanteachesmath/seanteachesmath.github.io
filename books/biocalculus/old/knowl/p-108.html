<p>We will learn how to interpret some higher derivatives soon, but we can already differentiate quite a few functions. We wll cover this soon, but you might as well try computing the second derivatives, as illustrated below.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t]
\text{first derivative} \amp = f'(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f(x)\Big) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(the function\Big)\\
\text{second derivative} \amp = f''(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f'(x)\Big) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(the derivative\Big)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The mechanics are just the same. For problems involving exponentials and logarithms be sure to simplify as fully as possible first using logarithm rules, otherwise we might not know what to do to compute the derivative!</p>
