<p>The mass of the animal varies continuously with time according to some function <span class="process-math">\(m(t)\text{.}\)</span> What if we were to choose different times for our measurement? How would our average mass change? What other methods might we have to compute the average mass over an <dfn class="terminology">interval</dfn>?</p>
<p>Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(m(t) = -t^{2}+6t + 6\)</span> that describes the mass of the quail during the growth experiment. Use the definite integral to calculate the average mass of the bird during the study? How does this compare to your earlier results?</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="applications-of-the-definite-integral.html#a-problem" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
