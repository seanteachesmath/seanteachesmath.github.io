<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">First order - revisited.</span></h5>
<p>Just like before, but now with a power of <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\)</span> on the right-hand side, we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{dA}{dt} \amp = -k A\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Our goal will be to move all of the <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>-like quantities to the left-hand side and leave any constants on the right-hand side.  This turns out to give some evidence in support of a well-known technique in differential equations called <em class="emphasis">separation of variables</em>.  We proceed as follows, first dividing by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on each side, then integrating each side with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t] \dfrac{dA}{dt} \amp = -k A\\
\dfrac{1}{A}\cdot\dfrac{dA}{dt} \amp = -k\\ 
\int \dfrac{1}{A}\cdot\dfrac{dA}{dt}\,dt \amp = \int -k\, dt \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is somewhat abstract, but we can immediately apply <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution.  To do so, we have to recognize that the unknown function is <span class="process-math">\(u = A(t)\)</span> and that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
du = A'(t)\,dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now, this isn't immediately useful, but remembering our notation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A'(t) =
\dfrac{dA}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so we can write,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
du = \dfrac{dA}{dt}\,dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Suddenly we are finished with our process of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substittution and can integrate.  Continuing from above</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t]
\int\underbrace{\frac{1}{A}}_{\frac{1}{u}}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{dA}{
dt}\,dt}_{du} \amp = \int -k\, dt\\ \int \frac{1}{u}\,du \amp = \int
-k\,dt\\ \ln|u| \amp = -kt+c \end{aligned} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Remembering above that <span class="process-math">\(u = A(t)\)</span> we can return to our chemistry notation, that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\ln|A(t)| = -kt+c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">What is left is to specify a value for <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Thinking of our physical situation we have that <span class="process-math">\(A(0) = A_{0}\)</span> (again as a chemist you might be picturing the quantity <span class="process-math">\([A]_{0}\text{,}\)</span> but this bracket notation is somewhat unsatisfying mathematically).  This gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\ln|A(0)| = \ln|A_{0}| =
-k(0) + c\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">or <span class="process-math">\(c = \ln|A_{0}|\text{.}\)</span> Since we expect <span class="process-math">\(A_{0} \gt
0\text{,}\)</span> we can neglect the absolute value bars in favor of notational simplicity. This gives the <dfn class="terminology">zeroth-order integrated rate law</dfn>,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\ln(A(t)) = -kt+\ln(A_{0})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Under these assumptions we expect the concentration of chemical species <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to decay linearly as a function of time with a slope of <span class="process-math">\(-k\text{,}\)</span> beginning from an initial concentration of <span class="process-math">\(A_{0}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In this case, the plot of the natural logarithm of the observed concentration will resemble a decreasing linear function.</p>
<p>We may also be aware that a first-order reaction corresponds to <dfn class="terminology">exponential decay</dfn>, in fact, exponentiating both sides of the formula above gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t]
\ln(A(t)) \amp = -kt+\ln(A_{0})\\
e^{\ln(A(t))} \amp = e^{-kt+\ln(A_{0})}\\
A(t) \amp = e^{-kt}\cdot e^{\ln(A_{0})}\\
A(t) \amp = e^{-kt}A_{0}\\
A(t) \amp = A_{0}e^{-kt}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Historically it was important to express data in terms of linear relationships, so a plot of the natural logarithm of a measurement that gave rise to a linear trend was a good indicator of this relationship and estimation of the slope <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> was relatively easy.  In contemporary times it is relatively easy to 'fit' nonlinear functions like exponentials, so it would be reasonable to plot the raw data, not its natural logarithm, and look the underlying exponential relationship and its parameter <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="applications-to-chemistry.html#first-order-revisited">in-context</a></span>
