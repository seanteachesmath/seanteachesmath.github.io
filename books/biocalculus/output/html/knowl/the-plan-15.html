<p>We continue our work on integration by introducing exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as those involving compositions.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Evaluating complicated integrals.</span></h4>
<p>We have learned a lot of techniques of differentiation. We will only learn how to undo a few of these, such as those derivatives involving \(e^x\text{,}\) \(\ln(x)\text{,}\) and the chain rule. For example, we omit the method required to ‘undo’ derivatives computed with the product rule.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Derivatives of \(e^x\) and \(\ln(x)\).</span></h5>
<p>Recall from our earlier work that \(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)=e^x\) and \(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(\ln{(x)})=\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\)What consequences do these facts have when we approach this problem from integration? Our new approach is to ask ‘what (unknown) function has a derivative that matches the integrand?’ rather than to ask ‘what is the derivative of the (known) function?’ In other words, ‘where did this derivative come from?’</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Facts about \(e^x\) and \(\ln(x)\).</span></h5>
<p>Since the indefinite integral undoes the action of the derivative</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\int e^x \, dx=e^x +c}

<p>and</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx=\ln{|x|}
+c}

<p>Compute \(\displaystyle\int
3e^x+\frac{1}{x}+x^{2} \, dx\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Compute \(\displaystyle\int
\displaystyle\frac{2}{x} +\frac{1}{4}e^x+\frac{1}{x^{4}} \, dx\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Compute \(\displaystyle\int 15e^{5x}\, dx\text{.}\) Taking the derivative of what function gives us \(f(x) = 15e^{5x}\text{?}\)</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Undoing differentiation by the Chain Rule.</span></h5>
<p>Recall that the Chain Rule says that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f\circ
g\Big)=\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(g(x))\Big)=\frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We can undo the chain rule using integration by a substitution process as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we need a brief definition for the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">differential</dfn> \(du\text{.}\) For \(u=g(x)\text{,}\) the differential is defined as</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{du = g'(x)\,dx}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is often called ‘\(u\)-substitution’ since we think of \(u\) as the name assigned to the inside function \(g(x)\) from the Chain Rule. To outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the variable \(x\text{,}\) though where you see an \(x\) below you can imagine another variable such as \(t\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Define a new variable, called \(u=g(x)\text{,}\) as some function of the old variable \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the differential \(du = g'(x)\,dx\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Put everything in the integral in terms of the new variable, \(u\text{.}\)(Replace the ‘inside function’ by the letter \(u\) and replace what remains by the definition for \(du\text{.}\)) Sometimes we have to rearrange a bit here so that \(du\) fits back in the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to integrate in terms of the new variable, \(u\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>After integrating, try to put everything back in terms of the old variable \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Find \(\displaystyle\int 2xe^{x^{2}} \, dx\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Evaluate \(\displaystyle\int
\frac{e^{3t}}{(1+e^{3t})} \, dt\text{.}\)</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Warning.</span></h5>
<p>Integration by substitution does not always work!</p>
<p>Try to evaluate \(\displaystyle\int 2x^{2}e^{x^{2}}
