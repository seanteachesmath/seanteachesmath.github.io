<p>List a few common measurements that are defined as products or quotients based on other measurements.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(p(x)=F(x)S(x)\)</span> where the ‘first’ function <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and the ‘second’ function <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> are both differentiable. Then</p>
<p>Given the product <span class="process-math">\(p(x)=(x-3)(x+2)\text{,}\)</span> find <span class="process-math">\(p'(x)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Find the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\displaystyle
(3e^x+3x+7)(2x^{2}+e^{3x})\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(w(x)=\displaystyle\frac{T(x)}{B(x)}\text{,}\)</span> where the ‘top’ function <span class="process-math">\(T(x)\)</span> and the ‘bottom’ function <span class="process-math">\(B(x)\)</span> are differentiable and <span class="process-math">\(B(x)\ne 0\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<p>Find the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\displaystyle\frac{x^{2}+3x+7}{2x^{2}}\)</span></p>
<p>Find the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\displaystyle\frac{3e^x+3x+7}{2x^{2}+e^{3x}}\)</span></p>
<p>The mass <span class="process-math">\(M(t)\)</span> (in grams) of a fruit is given by the product of its density <span class="process-math">\(\rho(t)\)</span> (in grams per cubic cm) and its volume <span class="process-math">\(V(t)\)</span> (cubic cm),</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
M(t) = \rho(t)V(t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Assume that the density is decreasing according to <span class="process-math">\(\rho(t) = 1-0.1t\text{,}\)</span> but the volume grows according to <span class="process-math">\(V(t) = 10+12t\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\rho(t)\)</span> decreases (a line with a negative slope) and <span class="process-math">\(V(t)\)</span> increases, is it obvious how <span class="process-math">\(M(t)\)</span> should behave?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Find the instantaneous rate of change at any time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (the derivative) of <span class="process-math">\(M(t)\text{,}\)</span> called <span class="process-math">\(M'(t)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Is the mass initially increasing or decreasing as a function of time?</p></li>
<li><p>At what time does <span class="process-math">\(M(t)\)</span> change behavior?</p></li>

<p>Hill functions are an important family of functions used to describe biological response to a stimulus. They were first used in 1919 (by Archibald Hill) to study and describe the cooperative binding kinetics of oxygen to hemoglobin molecules. They are defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
h(x)=\displaystyle\frac{x^n}{1+x^n}, \quad n&gt;0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Find the derivative of the Hill function with <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>For the function above compute leading behaviors at zero and infinity, as well as limits at zero and infinity.</p>
<p>The number of molecules <span class="process-math">\(n(t)\)</span> in a solution is the concentration of molecules <span class="process-math">\(c(t)\)</span> times the volume of the solution <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
n(t)=c(t)v(t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Assume the concentration decreases, <span class="process-math">\(c(t)=4-t^{2}\text{,}\)</span> and the volume increases, <span class="process-math">\(v(t)=1+3t\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>Consider a population of mice that obeys the equation <span class="process-math">\(N(t)=1+2t+t^{2}\text{.}\)</span> The number of mice with hantavirus is described by <span class="process-math">\(I(t)=3t\text{,}\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in months). The prevalence of hantavirus in the population is defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(t)=\displaystyle\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">How does the prevalence of hantavirus in the population change with time?</p>
<p>For the functions above (that is <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(N(t)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p(t)\)</span>) compute leading behaviors at zero and infinity, as well as limits at zero and infinity. What is surprising about the results of <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} p(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} I(t)\text{?}\)</span></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="derivatives-of-products-and-quotients.html#common-products-and-ratios-in-science" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
