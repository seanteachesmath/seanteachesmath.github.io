<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Undoing differentiation by the Chain Rule.</span></h5>
<p>Recall that the Chain Rule says that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f\circ
g\Big)=\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(g(x))\Big)=\frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We can undo the chain rule using integration by a substitution process as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we need a brief definition for the <dfn class="terminology">differential</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(du\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(u=g(x)\text{,}\)</span> the differential is defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{du = g'(x)\,dx}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is often called ‘<span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution’ since we think of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> as the name assigned to the inside function <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> from the Chain Rule. To outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> though where you see an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> below you can imagine another variable such as <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Define a new variable, called <span class="process-math">\(u=g(x)\text{,}\)</span> as some function of the old variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compute the differential <span class="process-math">\(du = g'(x)\,dx\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Put everything in the integral in terms of the new variable, <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span>(Replace the ‘inside function’ by the letter <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and replace what remains by the definition for <span class="process-math">\(du\text{.}\)</span>) Sometimes we have to rearrange a bit here so that <span class="process-math">\(du\)</span> fits back in the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to integrate in terms of the new variable, <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>After integrating, try to put everything back in terms of the old variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Find <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle\int 2xe^{x^{2}} \, dx\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle\int
\frac{e^{3t}}{(1+e^{3t})} \, dt\text{.}\)</span></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="more-complicated-integrals-and-integration-by-substitution.html#undoing-differentiation-by-the-chain-rule" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
