<p>Historically it was important to express data in terms of linear relationships, so a plot of the natural logarithm of a measurement that gave rise to a linear trend was a good indicator of this relationship and estimation of the slope <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> was relatively easy.  In contemporary times it is relatively easy to 'fit' nonlinear functions like exponentials, so it would be reasonable to plot the raw data, not its natural logarithm, and look the underlying exponential relationship and its parameter <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p>
