<p>We have learned a lot of techniques of differentiation. We will only learn how to undo a few of these, such as those derivatives involving <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\text{,}\)</span> and the chain rule. For example, we omit the method required to ‘undo’ derivatives computed with the product rule.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\)</span>.</span></h5>
<p>Recall from our earlier work that <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)=e^x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(\ln{(x)})=\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\)</span>What consequences do these facts have when we approach this problem from integration? Our new approach is to ask ‘what (unknown) function has a derivative that matches the integrand?’ rather than to ask ‘what is the derivative of the (known) function?’ In other words, ‘where did this derivative come from?’</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Facts about <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\)</span>.</span></h5>

<p>Recall that the Chain Rule says that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f\circ
g\Big)=\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(g(x))\Big)=\frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}}
\end{equation*}

<p class="continuation">We can undo the chain rule using integration by a substitution process as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we need a brief definition for the <dfn class="terminology">differential</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(du\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(u=g(x)\text{,}\)</span> the differential is defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{du = g'(x)\,dx}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is often called ‘<span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution’ since we think of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> as the name assigned to the inside function <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> from the Chain Rule. To outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> though where you see an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> below you can imagine another variable such as <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p>
