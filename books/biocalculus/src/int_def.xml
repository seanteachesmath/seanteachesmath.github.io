 <title>Area problems and definite integrals</title>
<introduction>
<p>
 We introduce a new type of integral problem with powerful
applications.
</p>
</introduction>
<p>
<title>Position from velocity</title>
Recall the formula of <em>your</em> velocity function <m> v(t) =
1.8</m>. From this function we used the relationship that
<m> \dfrac{dp}{dt} = v(t)</m> to compute our position function
<m>p(t)</m>.
</p>
<example xml:id="example-area-velocity">
<statement>
<p>
Suppose you walk from class to class with this velocity and it takes you
50 seconds to walk
from one class to the next, how many meters have you walked? Plot the
velocity function to find out.
</p>
<p>
At certain times hallways and doorways are crowded and prevent you
from maintaining your constant speedy pace towards class.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<example xml:id="ex-quadratic-velocity">
<title>Quadratic velocity</title>
<statement>
<p>
Consider that your velocity for a brief period of time is described by a
quadratic function
<m>v(t) = t^2</m>
as you accelerate from a red light where your initial velocity is zero.
<ol>
<li><p>
We try to fill the space, from left to right, under the graph
with rectangles whose widths are known and whose heights are related to
the height of the graph at some point.
</p></li>
<li><p>
We take advantage of the fact that the area of a rectangle by
multiplying its width and height.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Given the area of a collection of rectangles, we can add the
areas of the rectangles to get an approximation to the original
area.
</p></li>
</ol>
</p>
<!--
</p> -->
<p>
Draw <m>n = 5</m> left-hand rectangles to approximate the area un-
der the curve. Heights can be estimated from the graph or calculated
using the corresponding function value. Repeat the exercise above using
the same number of right-hand rectangles.

<p>
For the function <m>f(t) = t^2</m>, consider the following examples of left-hand
and right-hand Riemann sums used to approximate the value of the
definite integral, whose exact value will be calculated very soon.

<title>Definite integral</title>
<statement>
<p>
The result of computing a
<term>definite integral</term> is a number, representing the area under a curve (or
between the curve and the horizontal axis). In particular,
<me>\int_a^b f(t)\, dt = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\text{area of \(n\) rectangles}\right)</me>
read "the integral from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> of <m>f(t)</m> with respect to <m>t</m>.
This is the Riemann integral or definite integral defined to be the area
of <m>n</m> rectangles that collectively approximate the area under the curve
as <m> n\to\infty</m>.

<title>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
<statement>
<p>
For any continuous function <m>f(x)</m> and any indefinite integral <m>\displaystyle F(x) =
\int f(x)\,dx</m>,
<me>F(x) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \Big(F(x)\Big)\Big|_a^b = F(b)-F(a)</me>

 The value of <m>\int_0^1 t\,dt</m>, which gives the area under the
curve <m>f(t) = t^2</m> between <m>t = 0</m> and <m>t = 1</m> can be calculated using the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Since the integrand <m>t^2</m>
is continuous on the interval from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=1</m> we find
<me>
\begin{aligned}[t]
\int_0^1 t^2\,dt \amp= \Big(\dfrac{t^3}{3}\Big)\Big|_0^1\\
\amp= \Big(\dfrac{1^3}{3}\Big) -\Big(\dfrac{0^3}{3}\Big)\\
\int_0^1 t\,dt \amp= \dfrac{1}{3}
