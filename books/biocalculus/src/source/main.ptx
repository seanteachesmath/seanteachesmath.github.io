<title>Users guide</title>

<p> Welcome to what I hope is a fun, challenging, and rewarding
class. This packet of notes and a scientific calculator are really the
only things you should need for this class this semester. Each day we’ll
work through a few pages together in class.
</p>

<p> Occasionally I will pass out supplemental notes when something
relevant hits the news or post notes online if we skip an example in the
interest of time. With a three-hole punch, you should easily be able to
add to these notes.
</p>

<p> With the exception of a few <sq>Quick Problems</sq> at the
end of each section, the one thing you should notice that is missing
from this packet is anything that resembles homework. The <sq>Quick
Problems</sq> and included answers are merely for your practice and will
not be collected. Most homework for this class will be posted and
submitted using a free online homework system. Occasionally I will have
you hand in written problems with graphs or explanations.
</p>

<p> While it might seem a bit wasteful, I have probably printed the
associated notes
one-sided to give you additional space for writing, drawing, or scratch
work.
</p>

<p> Our first test covers Topics 1 to 7, our second test covers
Topics 8 to 14, our third test covers Topics 15 to 18. The final will be
comprehensive and may include questions from Topics 19 to 21 if time
permits.

<title>Mathematics as a language</title>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> We have plenty of ways of understanding and
describing our natural and physical world. We have names for levels of
biological organization, names for molecules, notation for reactions,
and so on.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Similar to the rules of written languages, the
symbols and rules of mathematics can help express certain ideas and
facts, and even relationships between multiple interacting
quantities.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Until reaching calculus (and beyond), we have a
relatively limited vocabulary and set of rules to work with when
describing complicated situations.</p> </li>
<li> <p> In particular, it takes calculus to be able to
clearly and compactly describe certain concepts relating to
<sq>change</sq> and <sq>amount</sq>.</p> </li>

<title>Abstraction</title>

<p> One (of many) important skills to succeed in
this class and beyond is abstraction. This is
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> the realization that the letter <m>x</m> in an
equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the height of a
tree, the size of a population, the age of an animal</p> </li>
<li> <p> the understanding that although we are
interested in a specific biological problem, we have to carefully apply
the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution – we solve an equation
the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or
represents a real-world problem</p> </li>
<li> <p> the recognition that many visibly different
biological dynamics might be linked by <em>the same</em> mathematical
description, and that what we learn from one system could teach us about
another – even though we might not recognize any direct biological
similarities between the two systems</p> </li>

In Question <xref ref="quick-units-area" /> of the previous

Is that relationship linear? Why or why not?
</p></statement>
<solution>
In Question <xref ref="quick-units-area" /> of the previous
section, we talked about the relationship between radius and diameter.
This <em>is</em> linear since <m>r = \dfrac{d}{2}</m>, in fact this is
proportional since the radius is a constant multiple

reminder that dividing by two is the same as multiplying by one half.

function do not match as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> from the left and
right. In all other cases we are looking at graphs that <sq>look more
familiar</sq> (no jumps, no open or filled points) at the points we are
evaluating the limits. Also notice that
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> we can say things like <m>x\to-0.5^+</m> which
refers to our attempt to approach the <m>x</m> value of <m>-0.5</m> from
the right hand side.</p> </li>
<li> <p> the superscript has nothing to do with the sign
of the number itself, only the direction from which we approach the
number.</p> </li>

two-sided limits once we get an understanding of some important

<p> Evaluating most limits (some of which we still need to

<title>Lines, secant lines, and rates of

<p> When talking about the average rate of change of
a measurement we compute the ratio of change in output over change in
input (often time). This ratio is also the slope of a line that we call
the secant line.
</p>

<p> The secant line connects two points that lie on
the graph of a function. We call one of the points the <term>base
point</term>.

<p> <em>When we pick our two points on a graph, we
are still computing the slope of a line through these points (even

<p> How well does your secant line capture the trend

<p> Consider the function <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> and the

lines that connect this base point to other points on the graph located
<m>\Delta x = 1, 0.5, 0.1, \text{and } 0.01</m> away.

<p> Guess the slope of the tangent line to
<m>f(x)</m> at <m>x_{0}=1</m>, based on the work above. Recall, the

<title>Average and instantaneous rates of

<p>	The slope of the secant line that connects the
points <m>(a, f(a))</m> and <m>(b, f(b))</m> on the graph of <m>f(t)</m>
is, <me>m_{sec} = \dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta

</p>

<p>	By bringing <m>b</m> closer and closer to <m>a</m>,
our secant line becomes a tangent line. To do this we introduce a limit,
<me>m_{tan} = \lim_{b\rightarrow a}\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},</me> which we

Since <m>\Delta t = b-a</m>, we have <m>b=a+\Delta t</m>. Taking

functions. We’ll cover this soon, but you might as well try computing
the second derivatives, as illustrated below. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{first derivative} = f'(x) &amp; = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f(x)\Big) =

mechanics are just the same. For problems involving exponentials and
logarithms be sure to simplify as fully as possible first using log

<m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined. If the function has an
optimum value, it is
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> a <term>local maximum</term> if the derivative

<li> <p> a <term>local minimum</term> if the derivative

</ul></p>

<p> <em>There is no local optimum value if the
derivative does not change sign.</em>
</p>

<p> The <em>Second Derivative Test</em> outlined
below helps is find local optima at critical points <m>x=c</m>:
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <p> If <m>f''(c)&lt;0</m>, then a local maximum
value of <m>f(x)</m><!-- linebreak -->occurs at <m>x=c</m> and the

function value is <m>f(c)</m><!-- linebreak --></p> </li>
<li> <p> If <m>f''(c)=0</m>, then we have to look
more<!-- linebreak -->closely at the sign of the first derivative<!--

</ul></p>

<p> <em>We have to know the locations of the
critical points (from the first derivative) in order to apply the
SDT!</em>
</p>

<p> Consider the functions <m>f(x) = x^{3}</m> and
<m>g(x) = x^{4}</m>, their first and second derivatives, and their
graphs.
Find local optima for each function.
</p>

<p> Mathematical functions of the form <m>f(x) =
xe^{-x}</m> are important in statistics and modeling (fisheries models,
for example). The graph is pictured below:

<p> From the graph, describe the behavior and
concavity.
</p>

<p> Is there a <sq>maximum</sq> value that the
function takes on? If so, where does this happen?
</p>

<p> Mathematical functions of the form <m>f(n) =
n(1-n)</m> are used to model the growth rate of populations that can be
described by logistic growth. Here the growth rate of the population is
a function of the current size of the population. Find the local maximum
growth rate of the population. At which size does it grow the fastest?
</p>

<p> Consider <m>f(x) = 4x^{3}+6x^{2}</m>, find critical

Using information about increasing, decreasing, concavity, and the
locations of local extrema <em>sketch the graph</em>.
</p>

<p> A global optimum value is guaranteed to exist
for a function on an interval. The global maximum is the largest value
that the function achieves, the global minimum is the smallest value
that the function achieves.<!-- linebreak --><em>Global extrema occur at
critical points or endpoints of the interval.</em><!-- linebreak -->
</p>

<p> The steps are as follows:
