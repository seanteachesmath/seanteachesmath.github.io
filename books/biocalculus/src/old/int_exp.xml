<introduction>
<p>
We continue our work on integration by introducing exponential and
logarithmic functions, as well as those involving compositions.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="sub-exp-int">
<title>Exponential and logarithmic functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
We have learned a lot of techniques of differentiation. We will only
learn how to undo a few of these, such as those derivatives involving
<m>e^x</m>, <m>\ln(x)</m>, and the chain rule. For example, we omit the
method required
to undo derivatives computed with the product rule.
</p>

<p>
Recall from our earlier work that
<m>\displaystyle\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(e^x\right) = e^x</m> and
<m>\displaystyle\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\ln(x)\right) = \dfrac{1}{x}</m>.
</p>

<p>
What consequences do these facts have when we approach this problem from
integration? Our new approach is to ask what (unknown) function has a
derivative that matches the integrand? rather than to ask what is the
derivative of the (known) function? In other words, where did this
derivative come from?
</p></introduction>
<fact xml:id="fact-exp-log">
<p>
Since the indefinite integral undoes the action of the derivative, we
have 
<me>\int e^x\,dx = e^x + c</me> and <me>\int \dfrac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln(|x|)
+ c</me>
</p>
</fact>
<example xml:id="example-exp-int">
<title>Basic indefinite integral: I</title>
<p>
Compute <m>\displaystyle \int 3e^x + \dfrac{1}{x} + x^2
dx</m>.

<example xml:id="example-exp-int2">
<title>Basic indefinite integral: II</title>
<p>
Compute <m>\displaystyle \int \dfrac{2}{x} + \dfrac{1}{4}e^x +
\dfrac{1}{x^4} dx</m>.

<example xml:id="example-exp-chain">
<title>Introduction to <m>u</m>-substitution</title>
<p>
Compute <m>\int 15e^{5x}\, dx</m>. Taking the derivative of what
function gives us <m>f(x) = 15e^{5x}</m>?
</p>
</example>     
<fact xml:id="fact-chain">
<title>Undoing differentiation by the Chain Rule</title>
Recall that the Chain Rule says that <me>\dfrac{d}{dx}\left((f \circ
g)(x)\right) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\left((f(g(x))\right) =
\dfrac{df}{dg}\dfrac{dg}{dx}</me>
We can undo the chain rule using integration by a substitution process
as well.

<introduction>
<p>
 Some words.
</p>
</introduction>
<p>
Before we begin, we need a brief definition.
</p>
<definition xml:id="differential">
<statement>
<p>
For <m>u = g(x)</m>, the differential is defined as
<me>du = g'(x) dx</me>
</p>
</statement>
</definition>
<algorithm xml:id="alg-usub">
<title>Integration by Substitution</title>
<statement>
<p>
This is often called <m>u</m>-substitution since we think of <m>u</m>
as the name assigned to the inside function <m>g(x)</m> from the Chain
Rule. To
outline the method we will think of integrating with respect to the
variable <m>x</m>, though where you see an <m>x</m> below you can
imagine another
variable such as <m>t</m>.
<ol>
<li><p>Define a new variable, called <m>u = g(x)</m>, as some function
of
the old
variable <m>x</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the differential <m>du = g'(x) dx</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Put everything in the integral in terms of the new variable,
<m>u</m>.
(Replace the inside function by the letter u and replace what remains
by the definition for <m>du</m>.) Sometimes we have to rearrange a bit
here so
that du fits back in the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to integrate in terms of the new variable, <m>u</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>After integrating, try to put everything back in terms of the old
variable <m>x</m>.</p></li>

The growth of female Atlantic sturgeon (fish) in the Hudson River,
New York, approximately follows the differential equation

hatching).
Solve this differential equation.
