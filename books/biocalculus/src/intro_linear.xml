<section xml:id="section-linear">
<title>Linear functions and their graphs</title>
<introduction>
<p>
Linear functions are the basis for most relationships that we can
think about.
</p>
</introduction>


<definition xml:id="def-linear">
<statement><p><title>Linear function</title>
A relationship <m>f(x)</m> defined by either
<ol>
<li><p><m>y = f(x) = mx + b</m>, with constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>,
or </p></li>
<li><p><m>y=f(x)=y_0+m(x−x_0)</m>,with constant <m>m</m> and a
point<m>(x_0, y_0)</m></p></li>
</ol>
is called a <term>linear function</term> between the variables <m>x</m>
and <m>y</m>. If the formula involves only adding and subtracting
constants with variables multiplied by constants, the equation describes
a linear function.

</p></statement>
</definition>

<definition xml:id="def-slope">
<statement><p><title>Slope</title>
The slope of a linear function passing through two points <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> and
<m>(x_1,y_1)</m> is defined as the ratio of the change in output over the change
in input ("rise over run”).
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p><title>Notation</title> In general, in biological applications we rarely
have inputs/outputs called <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> – for example we have mass and
volume. These labels, while different from what we are used to are meant
to make problems more meaningful!</p>




<example xml:id="example-temperature">
<title>Temperature conversion</title>
<p>
Here we will derive a common (and commonly mis-remembered) temperature formula.
<ol>
<li><p>Recall: What is the formula for computing the temperature in F if you know temperature in C?</p></li>
<li><p>Data: Consider the following data: <m>(0, 32),  (20, 68),  (37, 98.6), (100, 212)</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the points to determine whether a linear function holds.</p></li>
<li><p>Slope: Identify a pair of points and compute the slope.</p></li>
<li><p>Linear functions: Now write <m>F(C)</m>, first in point-slope form, then simplify to slope-intercept form.</p></li></ol>
</p>
</example>       

<example xml:id="example-point-slope-intercept">
<title>slope to point-slope to slope intercept</title> Notice that the definition <me>m=\dfrac{y_1 − y_0}{x_1 − x_0}</me>

gives us all we need to derive both point-slope form and slope-intercept form.
Let our point be <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and instead of <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, choose <m>(x,y)</m> to be any other point <em>on the line</em>.
<me>
\begin{aligned}[t]
m \amp =\dfrac{y − y_0}{x − x_0}\\
m(x-x_0) \amp =\dfrac{y − y_0}{\cancel{x − x_0}}\cancel{(x-x_0)}\\
m(x-x_0) \amp = y − y_0\\
y_0 + m(x-x_0) \amp = y\\
y \amp = y_0 + m(x-x_0) 
\end{aligned}
</me>
</example>


<example xml:id="example-recognizing-lines">
<title>Recognizing linear functions</title> Identify which of the following are examples of linear functions.
<ol>
<li><p><m>C(F)= \frac{5}{9}(F−32)</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>s(t) = −4.9t^2 − 5.0t + 100</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>M(V)=0.8V</m></p></li>
</ol>
</example>

<p><title>Interpolation</title> Frequently we use linear functions to interpolate or
predict values occurring between two known values. This technique is
called linear interpolation, and is illustrated in the following
example.</p>


<example xml:id="example-hiv">
<title>HIV and AIDS</title> Here we look at the onset of AIDS symptoms in the years after initial HIV infection. Four years after infection <m>17%</m> had symptoms, and seven years after infection <m>33\%</m> had symptoms.
<ol>
<li><p>Write the formula for a linear function that relates the percent of patients with AIDS symptoms to time (years measured since infection).</p></li>
<li><p>Define and interpret the slope and intercept (units included).</p></li>
<li><p>How many patients (what percent) have symptoms after five and a half years?</p></li>
<li><p>Using this model, at what time would you predict that half of all exposed patients have AIDS symptoms? What must you do to answer this question?</p></li>
</ol>
