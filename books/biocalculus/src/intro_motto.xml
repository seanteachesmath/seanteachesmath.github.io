<section xml:id="section-what-is">
<title>What is bio-calculus?</title>
<introduction>
<p>
We will introduce the basic ideas of mathematical modeling and highlight
concepts important to theoretical and empirical research.</p>
</introduction>

<p>Ask yourself "what role does mathematics have in the biological (and physical)
sciences?" Or, "where have you encountered 'math' in other classes, work, or
research?"</p>

<p><title>Mathematics as a language</title><ol>

<li><p> We have plenty of ways of understanding and describing our
natural and physical world. We have names for levels of biological
organization, names for molecules, notation for reactions, and so
on.</p></li>
<li><p>  Similar to the rules of written languages, the symbols and
rules of mathematics can help express certain ideas and facts, and even
relationships between multiple interacting quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>  Until reaching calculus (and beyond), we have a relatively
limited vocabulary and set of rules to work with when describing
complicated situations.</p></li>
<li><p>  In particular, it takes calculus to be able to clearly and
compactly describe certain concepts relating to "change" and
`amount'.</p></li>
</ol></p>

<p><title>Basic motivation.</title> Two observations: 
<ol>
<li><p> Observing, describing, and understanding <em>how things
change</em> is the critical and interesting part of the biological (and
physical) sciences.</p></li>
<li><p> <em>Calculus</em> is the mathematical study of
<em>change</em>.</p></li>
</ol></p>


<p><title>Applied mathematics.</title> Using mathematical theory,
notation, methods, and tools to answer general scientific questions
(biology, chemistry, physics, geology, ...)
<ol>
<li><p>make a measurement</p></li>
<li><p> describe how the measurement changes</p></li>
<li><p> develop a model -- translate from the languages of science (words,
diagrams, descriptions) to math (symbols and equations)</p></li>
<li><p> find solution using mathematical methods and make predictions
about the original problem</p></li>
</ol></p>

<p><title>Mathematical biology.</title> Special branch of applied
mathematics focused on biological dynamics.</p>

<p><title>Abstraction.</title> One (of many) important skills to
succeed in this class and beyond is <term>abstraction</term>. This is
<ol>
<li><p>the realization that the letter <m>x</m> in an equation might
represent the physical size of a cell, the height of a tree, the size of
a population, the age of an animal</p></li>
<li><p> the understanding that although we are interested in a specific
biological problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics
to achieve a solution -- we solve an equation the same way whether or
not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world
problem</p></li>
<li><p> the recognition that many visibly different biological dynamics
might be linked by <em>the same</em> mathematical description, and that
what we learn from one system could teach us about another -- even
though we might not recognize any direct biological similarities between
the two systems
</p></li>
</ol></p>


<!--><theorem xml:id="thm-product">
<p>
Suppose <m>p(x)=F(x)S(x)</m> where the 'first' function <m>F =
F(x)</m> and the 'second' function <m>S = S(x)</m> are both
differentiable. Then
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
p'(x) \amp= F(x)S'(x)+S(x)F'(x)\\
\frac{dp}{dx}\amp= F(x)\cdot \frac{dS}{dx} + S(x) \cdot
\frac{dF}{dx}
\end{aligned}</me>
</p>
</theorem>

<example xml:id="example-product">
<title>Basic quotient rule</title>
<p>
Suppose <m>w(x)=(x-3)(x+2)</m>. Find <m>w'(x)</m>.
<me>
\begin{aligned}[t]
w'(x) 	\amp= \frac{d}{dx}\left((x-3)(x+2)\right)\\
		\amp= (x-3)\frac{d}{dx}(x+2) + (x+2)\frac{d}{dx}(x-3)\\
		\amp= (x-3)(1) + (x+2)(1)\\
w'(x)	\amp= 2x-1
\end{aligned}
</me>
Notice that we could have expanded <m>w(x)</m> first by multiplying
the right-hand side, then taken the derivative of the result
term-by-term.
