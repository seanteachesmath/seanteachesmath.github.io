<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">These notes were originally written for MATH 056 at Swarthmore College and subsequently quite heavily modifited for courses taught at the University of Central Oklahoma. This course was developed and taught as MATH 056 in Fall 2011, and subsequently as MATH 4910/5910 in the Spring of 2013, 2015, and 2017. These notes were inspired by a course that I took as a first year graduate student at the University of Utah which was taught by Fred Adler.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Additional references used in the development of these notes (unfortunately at this point in time uncited within the text) are listed on the last page.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The structure of these notes might be jarring, but the goal is to facilitate rapid entry to inspired, independent investigations of interesting questions. Often books begin with discrete-time mathematical models (which are conceptually and mathematically interesting, but not of interest to most students), then spend a bit of time in one- and two-dimensional, continuous-time models (which are familiar and interesting, but time consuming and of limited applicability in many ’real-world’ situations). The goal here is introduce a few broad ideas of mathematical modeling and to take an early look at stochastic processes and to introduce modeling that scales to higher dimensional problems. Both of these approaches rely quite heavily on numerical tools.</p>
