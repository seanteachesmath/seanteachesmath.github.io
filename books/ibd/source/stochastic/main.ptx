<p> Models presented so far have been deterministic, meaning that the
structure of the model, combine with its initial conditions and
parameter values completely determine the behavior of the solutions. In
contrast, to this are stochastic models in which each application or
investigation of the model gives a unique realization of the dynamics.
In other words, the same model and conditions can give rise to

<term>very</term> different dynamics. These are connected in that we
understand the deterministic analog of a stochastic model to capture the
mean behavior (see <xref ref="fig-stoch-sample" />).

<p> Keep in mind that both deterministic models and stochastic models
have their place in mathematical modeling, but that more importantly
each allows us to apply different methods and to ask different
questions.

<title>Motivation</title>

<p> So far we have worked with deterministic models, most recently in
continuous time. An example of a deterministic model is <me>\frac{d^{}
{N}}{d {t}^{}}=rN,</me> where <m>r</m> is the growth rate of species
<m>N</m>. The solution to such a model is <me>N(t)=N_0e^{rt},</me> where
<m>N_0</m> is the initial population size. As <m>t\rightarrow\infty</m>,
we have either <m>N\rightarrow 0</m> if <m>b&lt;m</m> (<m>r&lt;0</m>), or
<m>N\rightarrow \infty</m> if <m>b&gt;m</m> (<m>r&gt;0</m>). In decaying
populations <m>r&lt;0</m>), solutions decay exponentially towards zero,
rather than actually reaching zero. Thus, we reach extinction
asymptotically, rather than in finite time. 
</p>

<p> But, at low numbers chance events become important. A single cell
could divide or die. If it dies, we have extinction. If <m>r&lt;0</m> we
<em>expect
</em> extinction, but what about when <m>r&gt;0</m>? If
<m>r&gt;0</m>, a single cell could die rather than divide, by chance,
even if it <em>should
</em> divide and grow in number. 
</p>

<p> Since we are focusing on the fates of individual cells, it is
perhaps important to think in terms of integer-valued states. Let
<m>N_0=n</m> be the initial number of cells present, perhaps in come
cell culture of a fascinating biological experiment. We should note
that, while the process is discrete (in the number of cells), time is
continuous. The number of animals changes by a single individual through
births (to the right) and deaths (to the left) as illustrated inÂ <xref ref="fig-bdp"/>.

<p> To make use of the diagram in <xref ref="fig-bdp" /> we should
let <me>P_n(t)=\text{Prob}(\text{counting \(n\) animals at time
\(t\)}),</me> and consider how these probabilities evolve in time for
all <m>n</m>. One important fact is that <me>P_i(0)=\begin{cases}1,
\,\text{if \(i=n\)}\\0, \,\text{otherwise}\end{cases},</me> since we
know that we start from <m>N_0=n</m> animals with absolute certainty. We
can derive the differential equation by conservation,
<me>\begin{aligned}
P_n(t+\Delta t) &amp; =\text{Prob(a birth)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n-1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\\
&amp; +\text{Prob(a death)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n+1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\\
&amp; +\text{Prob(no change)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;
\end{aligned}</me> First we will apply the definition of
<m>P_n(t)</m> and the others (i.e., <m>P_{n-1}(t)</m>). Notice that the
equation is presented in two columns, on the left is the format 
<sq>in
words
</sq> and on the right introduces the corresponding notation,
<me>\begin{aligned}
P_n(t+\Delta t) &amp; =\text{Prob(a birth)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n-1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad=\text{Prob(a birth)}\times P_{n-1}(t) \\ 
&amp; +\text{Prob(no change)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad+\text{Prob(no change)}\times P_{n}(t)
&amp; +\text{Prob(a death)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n+1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad+\text{Prob(a death)}\times P_{n+1}(t)\\
\end{aligned}</me> Below we could also consider <m>\text{Prob(no change)}</m> as <m>(1-\text{Prob(change)})</m>, where
<m>\text{Prob(change)}</m> is given by the probability of events
resulting in exit <em>from
</em> size <m>n</m>. The event probabilities
are, <me>\begin{aligned}
P_n(t+\Delta t) &amp; =\text{Prob(a birth)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n-1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad=(n-1)b\Delta t P_{n-1}(t) \\
&amp; +\text{Prob(no change)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad+(1-nb\Delta t-n\mu\Delta t) P_{n}(t)
&amp; +\text{Prob(a death)}\times\text{Prob}(\text{\(n+1\) animals at time \(t\)}) &amp;&amp;\qquad+(n+1)\mu\Delta t P_{n+1}(t)\\
\end{aligned}</me>
Finally, we can begin rearranging to derive the differential equation
for <m>P_n(t)</m>, <me>\begin{aligned}
P_n(t+\Delta t) &amp;=(n-1)b\Delta t P_{n-1}(t) +(n+1)\mu\Delta t P_{n+1}(t)+(1-nb\Delta t-n\mu\Delta t) P_{n}(t) \\ 
P_n(t+\Delta t) -P_n(t)&amp;=(n-1)b\Delta t P_{n-1}(t) +(n+1)\mu\Delta t P_{n+1}(t)-(nb\Delta t+n\mu\Delta t) P_{n}(t) \\
\frac{P_n(t+\Delta t) -P_n(t)}{\Delta t}&amp;=(n-1)b P_{n-1}(t) +(n+1)\mu P_{n+1}(t)-n(b + \mu) P_{n}(t)
\end{aligned}</me>
Now, taking the limit <m>\Delta t\rightarrow0</m>,<me>\frac{d^{}
{P_n(t)}}{d {t}^{}}=(n-1)b P_{n-1}(t) +(n+1)\mu P_{n+1}(t)-(nb-n\mu)
P_{n}(t) .</me> We have to assume that <m>P_i(t)=0</m> for any
<m>i&lt;0</m>, and accept a system of coupled equations for <m>n=0, 1,
2, \dots</m>. We will study this particular model with a suite of
techniques, including naive calculation, inspection, and somewhat
elegant probability theory.

<paragraphs xml:id="naive-calculation"> 
<title>Naive calculation</title>
<p> Looking at the first equation for <m>n=0</m>, <me>\frac{d^{}
{P_0(t)}}{d {t}^{}}=(-1)b P_{-1}(t) +(1)\mu P_{1}(t)-0\cdot (b -\mu)
P_{0}(t),</me> we simplify to <me>\frac{d^{} {P_0(t)}}{d {t}^{}}= \mu
P_{1}(t).</me> If we were to look at the equilibrium of <m>P_0</m>,
assuming <m>\mu\neq0</m>, we would need <m>P_1(t)\rightarrow0</m>. Since
<m>P_1</m> appears in the next equation, we require all
<m>P_i(t)\rightarrow0</m> for <m>i&gt;0</m>. Since <m>P_i(t)</m> are
probabilities, we require <m>\displaystyle\sum_0^\infty P_i(t)=1</m>,
which means that <m>P_0(t)\rightarrow1</m>. This suggests that
extinction is unavoidable, but a bit more work provides additional
insight. Specifically populations with <m>b&gt;m</m> can escape
extinction, with the probability of extinction of
<me>\left(\dfrac{m}{b}\right)^{N_0}</me> which for <m>b&gt;m</m> decays
geometrically as a function of the initial population size. With quite a
bit of effort, this result is very nicely illustrated in classic texts.

\frac{r}{r+\mu},</me> and similarly for a death,
<me>\operatorname{Prob}({\text{a death}})=1-\operatorname{Prob}({\text{a birth}})=
1-\frac{r}{r+\mu}=\frac{\mu}{r+\mu}.</me> To determine what
happens we consider the interval <m>[0,1],</m> which we divide, here,
into two subintervals whose widths reflect the event probabilities
above. For example, if <m>r=0</m> (<m>\mu&gt;0</m>), the probability of
a birth is zero and probability of a death is one. In contrast, if
<m>\mu=0</m> (<m>r&gt;0</m>), then the probability of a death is zero
and the probability of a birth is one. 
</p>

<p> More interesting cases occur if, for example, <m>r=8</m> and
<m>\mu=2</m>, then the probability of a birth is <m>\frac{4}{5}</m> and
the probability of a death is <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>. To illustrate this
last case, we divide the unit interval into subintervals <m>(0,
\frac{4}{5}]</m>, representing the probabilities of birth, and
<m>(\frac{4}{5}, 1)</m>, representing the probabilities of death. Then
we choose a uniform random number (a dart) and throw it at the divided
number line (a target). The interval in which it lands identifies our
next event. In this example, since <m>r&gt;&gt;\mu</m>, the probability
that a birth occurs is much larger than the probability that a death
occurs. Thus, the birth interval in the target is much larger than the
death interval, and we are more likely to have a birth.

interval, making this event the more likely outcome. That said, here we
have the less likely outcome of a death.

<p> Given that we can identify the event that occurs, our next task is
to identify the time until the event occurs. Here we assume that he
events occur at a constant rate <me>\lambda=(r+\mu)n,</me> and that the
time until the next event, <m>T</m>, is exponentially distributed with
parameter <m>\lambda</m>. Thus, <me>T\sim\exp(\lambda).</me> We can
easily sample numbers from certain distributions. To sample
exponentially distributed random numbers, we take advantage of its
cumulative distribution function, <m>F(t)=1-\exp(-\lambda t)</m>. We
pick a uniform random number <m>r_2</m> and solve for <m>t</m> using
<m>r_2=F(t)</m> to find our even time. <me>\begin{aligned} r_2 &amp; =
F(t)\\ &amp;= 1-\exp(-\lambda t)\\ \exp(-\lambda t) &amp; = 1-r_2\\
-\lambda t &amp; =\ln(1-r_2)\\ t &amp;
=-\frac{\ln(1-r_2)}{\lambda}\end{aligned}</me> Importantly, since
<m>r_2</m> is a random number so is <m>1-r_2</m>. In slight abuse of
notation, we relabel the argument of <m>\ln(\cdot)</m>, which is
<m>1-r_2</m>, by <m>r_2</m>,<me>t =-\frac{\ln(r_2)}{\lambda}.</me> Since
<m>r_2\in(0,1)</m>, the logarithm is negative, so the negative in front
ensures a positive event time <m>t</m>. 
</p>

<p> Now that we have identified both our event and the event eating
time, <m>t</m>, we simply update our state and repeat the process for
until we reach either a fixed number of events, a fixed final time, or a
population that becomes extinct (or reaches some other pre-specified
condition). An example solution to the birth-death process is plotted in
<xref ref="fig-stoch-sample" />, where unlike inÂ <xref ref="fig-in-class-sim" /> the rate of birth is non-zero.

stochastic process with the deterministic result (or expectation) in

<p> While the details of evaluating our claim are beyond our needs, we
can and should temper our 
<sq>everything vanishes
</sq> statement. In the
absence of immigration, populations that remain finite are bound to
reach extinction. They tend to do so rather quickly, after a string of
bad luck. Otherwise populations can grow to infinity, avoiding and
escaping the threat of extinction. 
</p>

<p> More sophisticated approaches, using generating functions (special
power series) let us calculate the mean extinction time for a given
problem.
