<title>Disclaimer</title>
	<p> These notes were originally written for MATH 056 at
	Swarthmore College and subsequently quite heavily modifited for
	courses taught at the University of Central Oklahoma. This
	course was developed and taught as MATH 056 in Fall 2011, and
	subsequently as MATH 4910/5910 in the Spring of 2013, 2015, and
	2017. These notes were inspired by a course that I took as a
	first year graduate student at the University of Utah which was
	taught by Fred Adler. </p>

	<p> Additional references used in the development of these notes
	(unfortunately at this point in time uncited within the text)
	are listed on the last "page". </p>

	<p> The structure of these notes might be jarring, but the goal
	is to facilitate rapid entry to inspired, independent
	investigations of interesting questions. Often books begin with
	discrete-time mathematical models (which are conceptually and
	mathematically interesting, but not of interest to most
	students), then spend a bit of time in one- and two-dimensional,
	continuous-time models (which are familiar and interesting, but
	time consuming and of limited applicability in many ’real-world’
	situations). The goal here is introduce a few broad ideas of
	mathematical modeling and to take an early look at stochastic
	processes and to introduce modeling that scales to higher
	dimensional problems. Both of these approaches rely quite
	heavily on numerical tools. </p>

<title>Themes</title>
<p> The main theme of the course is to introduce the 'art' of
mathematical modeling by using motivating examples from biology. We will
touch on mathematical disciplines including applications of calculus,
differential equation, linear algebra, probability, and more.
