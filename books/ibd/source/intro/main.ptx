	and definitions</title>

<p> A mathematical model is an abstract mathematical description of
	any (biological) system, using logic, notation, and techniques of
	mathematics. </p>

	<paragraphs xml:id="a-familiar-example"> <title>A familiar
	example</title>

<p> Picture a tall, cylindrical water tower with radius <m>r</m> in
	which the height of the water is <m>h</m>. We want to know how fast
	the water level is dropping as we draw water from the bottom of the
	tank at a fixed flow. Our situation relies on the following
	relationship between volume of water and height of water.
<me>(\text{change in volume})\propto(\text{change in height})</me>
	But what is the actual relationship between the two, and how do we
	replace <sq><m>\propto</m></sq> with <sq><m>=</m></sq>? First,
<me>V=\pi r^2 h,</me> and differentiating, <me>\frac{d^{} {V}}{d
	{t}^{}} = \pi r^2 \frac{d^{} {h}}{d {t}^{}}.</me> </p>

<p> Pause to think about this. We want to know how the height
<m>h(t)</m> is changing as a function of time. We are thinking of a
	cylinder with a fixed radius, <m>r</m>. We will assume that we are
	in control of the outflow from the tank, <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^{}
	{V}}{d {t}^{}}</m>. </p>

<p> We can write a model for the height, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
	{t}^{}}=\frac{\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}}{\pi r^2}.</me> </p>

<p> Let’s assume we fix the outflow at
<m>\displaystyle100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{ sec}}</m>, by
	adjusting the outflow knob. The first consequence is that the volume
	of water in the tank is decreasing, so that
<m>\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}</m> should be negative.
</p>

<p> We’ll now use our model to study the dynamics of water depth in
	two theoretical water tanks: one tall and thin and the other short
	and thick. </p>

<p> When <m>r=10</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
	{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(10
	\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft}}{\ text{sec}}.</me> So
	that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in approximately 3
	seconds. </p>

<p> When <m>r=100</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
	{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(100
	\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{100\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft} }{\text{sec}}.</me>
	So that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in
	approximately 5 minutes! </p>

<p> This model allows us to discuss two important and often confused
	concepts in modeling: the distinction between parameters and (state)
	variables. The <q>state variable</q> is the <sq>thing</sq> that we
	are making an effort to model. Here it is the height, <m>h(t)</m> of
	the water in the tower. Everything else - the outflow volume
<m>\left(\displaystyle \frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}\right)</m> and the
	radius <m>(r)</m> is known, or under our control. We call these
	things parameters. Changing parameters affects the evolution of
	state variables. </p>

	<paragraphs xml:id="counting"> <title>Counting</title>

<p> Models allow us to count things that might be too expensive, too
	time consuming, or otherwise impossible to count: animals, cells,
	proteins, viruses, molecules. </p>

<paragraphs xml:id="what-does-a-model-look-like"> <title>What does a
	model look like?</title>

	<p> A model is a description of <q>how things change</q> (like
	the height of water in a water tower). Biologically similar
	things might change in very different ways and be governed by
	very different processes. </p>


	<paragraphs xml:id="thinking-about-time"> <title>Thinking about
	time</title>

<p> We should think about how the organisms, or components of our
	model, interact with one another.<!-- linebreak -->Dynamics of some
	plants and animals are characterized by discrete, non-overlapping
	generations. </p>

<p><ul> <li> <p> Insects might reproduce over just a few days and be
	dormant over the remainder of the year. </p> </li>

	<li> <p> Plants might set seeds over a short season. </p> </li>

</ul></p>

<p> Alternatively, we might have a set of measurements at a regular
	interval (e.g., 2-weeks) that we wish to explain. Many human
	diseases are often reported to organizations like CDC and WHO at
	weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly intervals (e.g, measles, cholera,
	HIV). </p>

<p> Other organisms like yeast, bacteria, mice, and so on, might be
	best described by <sq>continuous-time</sq> dynamics. </p>

	<paragraphs xml:id="thinking-about-interactions">
	<title>Thinking about interactions</title>

<p> Interactions might be characterized as linear or non-linear.
</p>

<p><ul> <li> <p> From chemistry, <q>first-order reactions</q> are
	linear - exponential growth or decay result from first order
	reactions (linear-models). </p> </li>

	<li> <p> Reactions with multiple reactants (interactions between
	Na and Cl, foxes and bunnies, humans and zombies are give rise
	to nonlinear models - products or functions state variables.
	</p> </li>

</ul></p>

	<paragraphs xml:id="do-we-always-arrive-at-the-same-answer">
	<title>Do we always arrive at the same answer?</title>

<p> Most of the models we study will be deterministic. This means
	our model (a set of rules, and initial conditions) will always give
	the same answer. </p>

<p> In contrast, some models can handle (random) variability between
	individuals or at different points in time. These are stochastic
	models, and while often more complicated, they allow us to ask and
	answer very different questions. As an example we’ll look at
<q>birth-death process</q> models a bit later. </p>
