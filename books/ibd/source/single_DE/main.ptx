<p> Following the introduction of birth-immigration-death-emigration
(BIDE)<fn>	<p> We sometimes call this BIDE because it is slightly
more pronounceable than BDIE, and because it emphasizes and groups the
<sq>gain</sq> terms and the <sq>loss</sq> terms. </p></fn> models
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rn, \text{where }r = b-m</me> and
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rn - g, \text{where g is the emigration rate}</me>
we were challenged to consider models of immigration. Let <m>a</m>
denote the <sq>arrival</sq> or immigration rate. The model becomes
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rn + a</me> </p>

<p> The equilibrium is found from <m>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = 0</m> or setting
and solving <m>0 = rN^* + a</m>. Hence, the equilibrium is <m>N^* =
-\dfrac{a}{r}</m>. Now, this only makes sense when <m>r&lt;0</m>,
otherwise <m>N^*</m> itself is negative. If <m>r&gt;0</m> the population
grows naturally, aided more so by immigration. </p>

<p> Given very limited exposure to mathematical models, it is worth
pausing to see how this model fits into a broader context. We will pause
from work developing and analyzing specific models to look at the
features of our model(s) so far, and what other alternatives are
available to us: dimension, linearity versus nonlinearity, qualitative
versus quantitative analysis, and determinism versus stochasticity. </p>


<paragraphs xml:id="dimension"> <title>Dimension</title>

<p> The dimension of a mathematical model refers to the number of
variables being tracked. For example, <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN</me> is a
one-dimensional (1D) ordinary differential equations model for
<m>N(t)</m>. Tracking additional populations (e.g., other species) or
subpopulations (e.g., groups or strata within a species) requires models
of higher dimensions, soon enough we will arrive at these. </p>

</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="linearity"> <title>Linearity</title>

<p> Mathematical models that ignore <em>interactions</em> between
individuals are linear models (for example, on the right hand side of
the differential equation). Explicitly modeling interactions between
individuals introduces nonlinearities into the model. This happens
regardless of the model dimension. We can study 1D nonlinear models
(that include interactions between individuals) or higher-dimensional
nonlinear models. </p>

</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="quantitative-and-qualitative-analyses">
<title>Quantitative and qualitative analyses</title>

<p> Trained as mathematicians, we are much more likely to be familiar
with exact or <sq>quantitative</sq> approaches, methods, or solutions.
In particular, when we imagine the solution to a particular problem we
are likely to expect
<ul>
<li> <p> a specific formula, or </p> </li>
<li> <p> a specific numerical value </p> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Despite this, there is much room for <sq>qualitative</sq> or more
descriptive approaches, methods, or solutions. In particular, through
development and analysis of mathematical models we want to gain an
appreciation for qualitative (graphical) solutions. To compare the two,
we will outline potential pros and cons, or strengths and drawbacks.
But, as one develops experience, what once may have seemed like a
drawback might begin to look more and more like a strength of a
particular approach. </p> </paragraphs>


<paragraphs xml:id="drawbacks-of-qualitative-analysis"> <title>Drawbacks
of qualitative analysis</title>

<p> Perhaps the biggest drawback of qualitative methods is that we are
really limited to applying these approaches to models of lower
dimension. These methods work well for models of 1 or 2 dimensions
(i.e., variables). Occasionally we are lucky enough to have
opportunities to view higher dimensional systems in lower dimension by
clever analysis techniques, so we can stretch the territory of
qualitative methods a bit in some cases. We are able to get
<em>only</em> broad information about our solutions or the behaviors of
our mode (if you omit the word only, however, this potential drawback
looks suspiciously like a strength). We could distinguish between </p>

<p><ul> <li> <p> oscillations or not, or </p> </li>

<li> <p> growth or decay </p> </li>

</ul></p>

<p> and identify conditions under which these behaviors occur. </p>

</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="strengths-of-qualitative-analysis"> <title>Strengths
of qualitative analysis</title>

<p> Qualitative analysis requires minimal assumptions about the
numerical values for rates (parameters), which in many cases are hard to
find, especially at the beginning of a project. This analysis can also
help give information about interesting relationships between
parameters. In particular, based on the discussion above, understanding
under which parameters oscillations occur or not, or under which
parameters solutions grow or decay, is powerful information. </p>

</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="drawbacks-of-quantitative-analysis">
<title>Drawbacks of quantitative analysis</title>

<p> Counter to our intuition, <sq>closed form</sq> solutions to
interesting models are often impossible to find or are uselessly complex
when found. If we seek numerical solutions or graphs of analytical
solutions, we need precise numerical values for initial conditions and
parameters. For example, when applying our qualitative methods to our
emigration model, we found that <m>N^* = \dfrac{g}{r}</m>. This analysis
require little, if any, assumptions on <m>g</m> and <m>r</m> other than
that they were <sq>some positive values.</sq> </p>

<p> Sometimes we get lucky and models are solvable and solutions provide
intuition. In other cases, even <em>good guesses</em> of parameter
values can help generate <em>intuition building</em>’ numerical results
about the model and its dynamics. </p> </paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="deterministic-models"> <title>Deterministic
models</title>

	<p> In general we are unable to investigate certain questions about
	extinction with models like <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN</me> because the
	solution <me>N(t) = N_0e^{rt}</me> only approaches zero in the limit
	as <m>t\to\infty</m> (given <m>r&lt;0</m>), but never
	<em>reaches</em> 0. In contrast to this, stochastic models, whose
	realizations are illustrated in Figs. <!--<xref
	ref="fig::coin_flips"
/> and <xref ref="fig::coin_flips_100" />-->
	certainly demonstrate extinction. Moreover, the stochastic results
	allow a variety of new questions about phenomenon related to
	extinction. We could investigate things such as the variability
	(i.e., variance) in population size as time goes on or the average
	time to extinction for small populations where stochasticity might
	be important. </p>

	<title>Key concepts in continuous-time models</title>

<p> In dynamical systems and mathematical modeling we are often
interested in the <sq>long-term</sq> behavior of solutions to our
models. To lay out a few definitions and concepts we will consider a
generic dynamical system, <me>\frac{d^{} {x}}{d {t}^{}}=f(x),</me> where
<m>f(x)</m> is some nice function and <m>x(0)=x_0</m> is a known initial
value. </p> </paragraphs>


<definition xml:id="definition-equilibrium-point"> <title>Equilibrium
point</title>

	<p> An <em>equilibrium point</em> is a value of the solution that is
	unchanging in time. <!--linebreak -->For a differential equation
	<me>\frac{d^{} {x}}{d {t}^{}}=f(x),</me> <m>x^*</m> is an
	<em>equilibrium point</em> if <m>f(x^*)=0</m>. Stability of
	equilibria helps us characterize the long term behavior of a model
	using information from equilibria. While there are mathematical
	varieties of <em>stability</em> we will consider <em>local
	asymptotic</em> stability. </p>

	<definition xml:id="definition-stable-equilibrium-point">
	<title>Stable equilibrium point</title>

<p> A <em>stable equilibrium point</em> attracts solutions that start
nearby, alternatively, it is stable if small perturbations from the
equilibrium decay to zero. An equilibrium <m>x^*</m> of

</definition>

<p> For the remainder of this section, we will study the logistic growth
equation, its relationship to the discrete logistic model, its
relationship to disease transmission in a closed population, and a few
extensions. The logistic growth equation is given by,<me>\frac{d^{}
{N}}{d {t}^{}}=rN\Big(1-\frac{N}{K}\Big).</me> Let <m>N^*</m> be an
equilibrium point, so that we can write <m>N(t)=N^*+n(t).</m> We will
derive a stability condition for an arbitrary equilibrium point,
starting by identifying the dynamics of <m>n(t)</m>, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\frac{d^{} {}}{d
{t}^{}}\Big(N^*+n(t)\Big)\\ &amp;=0+\frac{d^{} {n}}{d
{t}^{}}.\end{aligned}</me> Now, substituting the formula for <m>N(t)</m>
and expanding, <me>\begin{aligned} \frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}\\ &amp;=r(N^*+n)\Big(1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)\\
&amp;=rN^*\Big(1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)+rn\Big (1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)\\
&amp;=\cancel{rN^*\Big(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\Big)}
-\frac{rN^*n}{K}+rn\Big(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\Big) -\cancel{\frac{rn^2}{K}}\\
&amp;=r\Big(1-\frac{2N^*}{K}\Big)n\\ \frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=
f'(N^*)n\end{aligned}</me> In the last step we can see that the terms
that remain are equivalent to the derivative of <m>f(N)</m>, with
respect to <m>N</m> evaluated at <m>N^*</m>. Here we linearize by
substituting our formula for the solution and dropping al higher order
terms in <m>n(t)</m>. You could do this, more formally or generally, by
Taylor series. </p>

<p> Solutions to <me>\frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}= f'(N^*)n</me> decay to
zero if <m>f'(N^*)&lt;0</m> and grow if <m>f'(N^*)&gt;0</m>. Hence, an
equilibrium point <m>N^*</m> (trivial or not) is stable if
<m>f'(N^*)&lt;0</m> and unstable if <m>f'(N^*)&gt;0</m>. </p>

<p> Evaluating derivatives should work in general, but it is not our
only tool. Today we will use graphical methods to develop a qualitative
understanding of the dynamics of a harvested population. If we think
about what our model means, we can make progress without tackling
sometimes frustrating, other times uninspiring, algebra. </p>

<section xml:id="continuous-time-models-derivations">> 
<title>Continuous-time models</title>

<paragraphs xml:id="continuous-time-models">
<title>Continuous-time models</title>

<p> The fundamental difference between what we will do and what we have
done so far is our treatment of time. We will now consider continuous
processes, as the difference between <m>t</m> and <m>t+1</m> becomes
small. We will use derivatives and talk about <sq>change</sq> in
population sizes. We will write models using derivatives because we tell
our story about <sq>how things change.</sq> We cannot tell a story about
population size at time <m>t</m>, we can tell a story about how
population size at time <m>t</m> changes. </p>

<p> Let <m>N(t)</m> be the concentration of brain-eating amebae (<url
href="http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/">http:
//www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/</url>) at time
<m>t</m> living in a warm lake. Naegleria reproduce at rate <m>b</m> and
die at rate <m>m</m> per time. We take two closely spaced water samples
to determine whether naegleria is on the rise or it is otherwise
<sq>safe</sq> to swim. The future concentration <m>N(t+\Delta t)</m> is
equal to the following:<me>\begin{aligned}
N(t+\Delta t)&amp;=\overbrace{(1+b\Delta t)}^{\text{reproduction}\atop{\text{by survivors}}}\underbrace{(1-m\Delta t)N(t)}_{\text{survivors}}\\
&amp;=(1+b\Delta t- m \Delta t-mb(\Delta t)^2)N(t)\\
&amp;=N(t)+ (b-m)\Delta t N(t) - mb(\Delta t)^2
N(t).\end{aligned}</me> Today we really started with the <em>last</em>
line in the derivation which assumed that only one event was possible
(i.e., we can think that we immediately ignored that individuals that
died in a short interval gave birth at the same time.). We can think of
<m>m</m> as the per time probability of mortality, so that <m>m\Delta
t</m> is the fraction of naegleria that die in an interval of length
<m>\Delta t</m>. Finally, <m>1-m\Delta t</m> is the fraction of
survivors from a previous time step. Those that survive, <m>(1-m\Delta
t)N(t)</m>, are <sq>allowed</sq> to reproduce, and contribute themselves
(the <sq>1</sq>) plus their offspring (the <sq><m>b\Delta t</m></sq>) to
the future generation. </p>

<p> Previously (when thinking in discrete-time) we worked with fractions
of survivors and now we are suddenly transitioning to working with
rates. When we took <m>\Delta t=1</m> unit of time it may have been easy
enough to convince ourselves that the fraction of individuals that
survive an interval of length <m>\Delta t=1</m> unit was some number
<me>q=1-m.</me> where <m>m</m> is the fraction that die per unit time
step. If we put the <m>\Delta t</m> back into the equation we see the
intermediate, <me>q\Delta t=1-m\Delta t.</me> We need this per unit time
survival probability, <m>0\leq q\Delta t\leq1,</m> which hopefully
suggests that we need, <me>0\leq 1-m\Delta t\leq1.</me> A bit of
entertaining algebra shows that we need, <me>0\leq m \leq
\frac{1}{\Delta t}.</me> So, when <m>\Delta t=1</m>, as with our
discrete-time models, we needed <m>0\leq m\leq 1</m>. What we really
need is the product <m>m\Delta t\leq 1</m>, so that as <m>\Delta
t\rightarrow0</m>, <m>m</m> itself can become large and still preserve
this inequality. In fact, as <m>\Delta t\rightarrow0</m> we allow
<m>m\rightarrow\infty</m>! </p>

<p> We often label <m>r=b-m</m> as the intrinsic growth rate, with units
<m>\frac{1}{\text{time}}</m>, so that, <me>N(t+\Delta t)=N(t)+r\Delta t
N(t)-mb(\Delta t)^2N(t).</me> Rearranging, <me>N(t+\Delta
t)-N(t)=r\Delta t N(t)-mb(\Delta t)^2N(t),</me> and dividing by
<m>\Delta t</m>, <me>\frac{N(t+\Delta t)-N(t)}{\Delta t}=r N(t)-mb\Delta
t N(t).</me> Now, taking the limit as <m>\Delta t\rightarrow0</m>,
<me>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}=r N(t),</me> since the last term still
contains a factor of <m>\Delta t</m>. </p>

<p> We can read this differential equation as<me>\text{the change in
}N(t)\text{ is proportional to }N(t).</me> Unlike before this change can
just as easily be positive or negative. When the change (derivative of a
function) is positive, we know from calculus that the function is
increasing. When the change is negative, we know that the function is
decreasing. </p>

<p> Looking at our definition of <m>r=b-m</m>, if the mortality rate
outweighs the birth rate the net, or intrinsic, growth rate is negative
(in these cases it is sometimes useful to explicitly write a negative
sign in the differential equation). Otherwise, if births outweigh
mortality, it is positive. Like before, we will plot the right hand side
of our model as a function of the population size. Rather than calling
it a ’cobwebbing diagram’ we will call this a <sq>phase-line
diagram.</sq> Unlike before this is a graph of <q>change vs. size</q>
not <q>next vs. now.</q> </p>

<p> If we plot the <q>change</q> in <m>N(t)</m> as a function of
<m>N(t)</m>, we can determine whether or not <m>N(t)</m> will increase
or decrease in size from a given initial condition, <m>N(0)</m>, by
reading the derivative. </p>

<figure> <image source="./images/phase.png"/> <caption>Phase-line diagram. The
dotted line, <m>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}=0</m> for all <m>N</m>
requires <m>r=0</m>. The change in the ’blue’ population is non-negative
at all population size (and only zero at <m>N=0</m>), thus if it starts
at <m>N(0)\neq0</m> it will always grow. The change in the ’red’
population is non-positive at all population size (and only zero at
<m>N=0</m>), thus if it starts at <m>N(0)\neq0</m> it will always
shrink. </caption> </figure>

<p> Looking at Fig. <xref ref="fig::phase" />, the <sq>blue</sq>
population starts at <m>N(0)=N_0</m> and grows. It grows at a faster and
faster rate as it grows. In contrast the <sq>red</sq> population shrinks
rapidly at first, but when it reaches smaller population sizes the rate
it which it shrinks decreases. </p>

<p> Before developing our <sq>method</sq> for solving all future
problems, we will actually solve this one analytically. This is one of
the few times we can solve our model analytically. As we do this, we
will not pay much attention to whether or not <m>r</m> is positive or
negative. In general, we expect parameters to be non-negative, but here
<m>r=b-m</m> is a sort of <sq>compound</sq> parameter and can be
negative when <m>m</m> (a positive parameter) is larger than <m>b</m> (a
positive parameter). To allow for growth or decay, without having to
worry about negative parameters, we will specify <m>r=b-m</m>. </p>

<p> Recall, <me>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}=(b-m)N.</me>
<me>\begin{aligned} \frac{dN}{N}&amp;=r\,dt\\
\int_0^s\frac{dN}{N}&amp;=\int_0^s (b-m)\,dt\\
\ln(N)\Big|_0^s&amp;=(b-m)t\Big|_0^s\\ \ln(N(s))-\ln(N_0)&amp;=(b-m) s\\
\ln(N(s))&amp;=\ln(N_0)+(b-m) s\\ N(s)&amp;=\exp(\ln(N_0)+(b-m) s)\\
&amp;=\exp(\ln(N_0))\exp((b-m) s)\\ N(s)&amp;=N_0\exp((b-m)
s)\\\end{aligned}</me> Replacing <m>s</m> by
<m>t</m>,<me>N(t)=N_0\exp((b-m) t),</me> and we can see that when
<m>b&lt;m</m>, <m>N(t)\rightarrow0</m>. Otherwise, when <m>b&gt;m</m>,
<m>N(t)\rightarrow\infty</m>. If <m>b=m</m>, then <m>r=0</m> and
<m>N(t)</m> never changes from <m>N_0</m>. We might be interested in
using the formula for <m>N(t)</m> to compute the half-life (commonly
<m>\tau_{1/2}</m>) or doubling time (commonly <m>\tau_2</m>). </p>

<p> Before moving on to nonlinear models, guided by our prior modeling
experiences we should recognize that we could write models of the form
<me>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}=(b-m)N-h,</me> or <me>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d
{t}^{}}=(b-m)N+s.</me> Biologically, what do these models say?
Mathematically, how might you solve them? </p> </paragraphs>
