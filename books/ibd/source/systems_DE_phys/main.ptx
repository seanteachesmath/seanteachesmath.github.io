<introduction>
<p>
The introduction to units will highlight the <sq>fact</sq> that
units in reaction kinetics are somewhat less tangible and slightly more
difficult to interpret. We will study the dynamics of cell receptors
(<m>X_0, X_1</m>) as they shuttle extracellular nutrients (<m>N</m>)
into the cell. We denote the concentration of cellular nutrient by
<m>C</m>. 
</p>
</introduction>

<p>
We wish to apply the <sq>law of mass action</sq> which simply
states, 
</p>


<p>
<em>in a bimolecular reaction, the reaction rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of reactants</em>.

</p>


<p>
Assuming that <m>[A]</m> and <m>[B]</m> are the concentrations of
reactants, <me>\begin{aligned} \text{rate}&amp;\propto [A][B]\\
&amp;=k[A][B],\end{aligned}</me> where the constant of proportionality,
<m>k</m>, is called the <sq>rate constant.</sq> 
</p>


<p>
Since the law of mass action relies on concentrations of reactants,
we must reconsider our receptors and nutrients in terms of
<sq>concentrations</sq>. For a given cellular component <m>Z</m>, the
<sq>volumetric concentration of <m>Z</m></sq> is,
<me>\left[\text{concentration}\atop{\text{of }Z}\right]=\left[\text{average number}\atop{\text{of}~Z~\text{per cell}}\right]\times\left[\text{average number of}\atop\text{cells per volume}\right].</me> Treating
<m>N</m>, <m>X_0</m>, <m>X_1</m>, and <m>C</m> as volumetric
concentrations we can use the reaction diagram (<xref ref="fig-nutrient-recept" />) to build differential equations to
describe the changes in concentrations. 
</p>

<p>
As an example, there are two ways that the extracellular nutrient
concentration changes giving two terms to the <m>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d
{t}^{}}</m> equation. <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -\left(\text{losses when free nutrient binds to empty receptor}\right)\\
&amp;\qquad +\left(\text{gains when occupied receptors release nutrient extracellularly}\right)\\
&amp; = -k_+ N X_0+ k_- X_1
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
Similarly, we can add the remaining equations, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N X_0 + k_- X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_0}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N X_0 + k_- X_1 + k_i X_i\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N X_0 - k_- X_1 - k_i X_i\\ 
\frac{d^{}{C}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_i X_1
\end{aligned}</me> Given this model, our
first goal is to make some simplifications through astute observations.
Both <m>X_0</m> and <m>X_1</m> are receptor states, and if we add the
two differential equations, <me>\frac{d^{} {X_0}}{d {t}^{}}+\frac{d^{}
{X_1}}{d {t}^{}}=0,</me> we see that the total receptor concentration is
conserved, <m>R</m>. With this we can write <m>X_0=R-X_1.</m>
<me>\begin{aligned} 
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N (R-X_1) +k_- X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{} {X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N (R-X_1) - k_- X_1 -k_i X_i
\end{aligned}</me> Reshuffling a bit, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N R+(k_+N + k_-) X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N R- (k_+ N + k_- + k_i)X_i
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
We can study these equations in the phase plane. Assuming all
parameters are positive, both nullclines saturate to a value
<m>X_1\rightarrow R</m> at large <m>N</m>. Knowing very little about
parameters, we know that the half saturation constant of the <m>X_1</m>
nullcline is larger than that of the <m>N</m> nullcline. The nullclines,
direction arrows on the nullclines, and a sample trajectory are
illustrated in <xref ref="fig-mm-kinetics" />.

<p>
Following on the heels of the quasi-steady
state assumption, we will close with an application of fast and slow
dynamics that arises in mathematical models of neurons. 
</p> 

<p>
This example, called the FitzHugh-Nagumo model allows us to synthesize much
of the material from continuous time dynamical systems: phase plane,
equilibria, analysis, and approximation.
