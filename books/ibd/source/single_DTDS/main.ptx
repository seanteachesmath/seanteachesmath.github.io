parameter that characterizes our population. At the beginning of summer
we are lucky enough to have only <m>N_0=2</m> dandelions in the front
yard. </p> <p> This is one of the few models we can actually solve.

flower does better than replacing itself we will always have an
increasing number of flowers. If each flower fails to replace itself,
our population will shrink. Solutions are tabulated in Tab. <xref

<p>
We can extract more biological information by considering the factors
contributing to the per capita production rate, <m>r</m>. Population
growth depends on seedling recruitment and survival. Let, </p> 

<table> <title></title> 
<tabular> <row class="odd"> <cell halign="left"><m>s</m></cell> <cell halign="left">be the number of
seedlings generated per plant</cell> </row> <row class="even"> <cell halign="left"><m>\sigma</m></cell> <cell halign="left">be the fraction
of seedlings that survive and grow to adulthood</cell> </row> <row
class="odd"> <cell halign="left"><m>a</m></cell> <cell halign="left">be
the fraction of adults that survive</cell> </row> </tabular> </table>
<p> We can re-write our model <me>\begin{aligned} 
N_{t+1} &amp;= rN_t\\
&amp;=s\sigma N_t+a N_t\\ 
N_{t+1} &amp;= (s\sigma+a)N_t
\end{aligned}</me> </p> <p> This suggests a few ways that
a population can grow, </p> 
<p><ul>
<li> <p> highly productive adult plants that generate lots of seedlings (large <m>s</m>) </p> </li>
<li> <p> highly viable seedlings that are likely to survive to <sq>adulthood</sq> </p> </li>
<li> <p> tough adult plants that are likely to survive </p> </li>
</ul></p> 

<p> In all, we need <m>r=s\sigma+a&gt;1</m> for the plants to
grow. </p> <p> Thinking about equilibria is key to understanding
dynamics of dandelions. Equilibria (or steady-states, or fixed-points)
are values at which the solution is unchanging. With our notation this
means <m>N_{t+1}=N_t=N^*</m>. By inspection of <xref ref="fig-dandelion"
/>, the only equilibrium point is <m>N^*=0</m>,
this is the only place that either of our labeled lines intersect the
diagonal. </p>

</example> 


<example xml:id="example-immigration">
<title>Growth with import</title> <p> It might
be the case, however, that our neighbors secretly transplant dandelions
in our yards at night. To mimic this unkind reality, assume that
<m>F\geq0</m> flowers are arriving each week. Our new model
is,<me>N_{t+1}=r N_t+F.</me> </p> <p> How does <sq>flower
immigration</sq> affect dynamics? If we replace both <m>N_{t+1}</m> and
<m>N_t</m> by <m>N^*</m> the equilibrium value, we have
<me>N^*=rN^*+F.</me> This gives us a value for the flower population,
<me>N^*=\frac{F}{1-r},</me> which tells us that <m>N^*&gt;0</m> if
<m>r&lt;1</m> and <m>N^*&lt;0</m> if <m>r&gt;1</m>. It is important to
notice early on that only non-negative equilibria make sense on most
biological situations, especially with regard to population dynamics.
With immigration (importation of plants), solutions can be traced on the
diagrams in <xref ref="fig-dandelion2"/>. </p>
</example>

<paragraphs xml:id="computational-trick">
<title>Computational
trick.</title>

<p> One way to solve this problem is to study deviations from the
equilibrium, <m>N^*</m>. We’re going to assume that <m>r&lt;1</m>, since
it is only then that we have a sensible equilibrium. </p>

<p> Let <m>x_t</m> be the deviation from equilibrium at time <m>t</m> so
that, <me>\begin{aligned} {2} N_t &amp;=N^*+x_t &amp; \qquad\text{(the
definition)}\\ N_0&amp;=N^*+x_0 &amp; \qquad\text{(the initial
condition)}\\\end{aligned}</me> </p>

<p> And finally, <me>\begin{aligned}
x_{t+1} &amp;=N_{t+1}-N^* &amp;
\qquad\text{(from the definition)}\\ 
x_{t+1} &amp;=\left(rN_t+F\right)-N^* &amp; \qquad\text{(from the model)}\\
x_{t+1} &amp;=\left(r\left(N^*+x_t\right)+F\right)-N ^* &amp; \qquad\text{(from the definition)}\\
x_{t+1} &amp;=\left(rN^*+F\right)+rx_t-N^* &amp; \qquad\text{(shuffle)}\\
x_{t+1} &amp;=\left(N^*\right)+rx_t-N^* &amp; \qquad\text{(equilibrium condition)}\\ 
x_{t+1} &amp;=rx_t &amp; \qquad\text{(evolution of }x_t\text{)}\\
\end{aligned}</me> </p>

<p> So, it looks like <m>x_t</m> evolves according to
<me>x_t=r^tx_0.</me> Which gives, <me>\begin{aligned} N_t&amp;=N^*+x_t\\
&amp;=N^*+r^tx_0\\ &amp;=N^*+r^t\left(N_0-N^*\right)\\
N_t&amp;=(1-r^t)N^*+r^tN_0.\end{aligned}</me
>Thus, the solution is a weighted average
of <m>N^*</m> and <m>N_0</m>, and depends on the weight <m>r</m>. For
<m>r&lt;1</m> weight moves from <m>N_0</m> to <m>N^*</m> as <m>t</m>
increases (the abundance of the initial flowers is reduced). Since we
have a formula for <m>N^*</m>, we can also plug it into the final
equation above ...formula... We can see what <sq>generations</sq> form our
population at any given week using the last of the above formulas. Of
course, we could have started here by applying our model recursively.
But, this approach gives some nice information about our solution in
terms of equilibria (<m>N^*</m>), initial values (<m>N_0</m>), and
perturbations (<m>x_t</m>). </p>

<title>Nonlinear discrete-time models (1D)</title>

<paragraphs xml:id="review-linear-models">
<title>Review: Linear models</title>

<p> We want to outline our options for solving linear, discrete-time,
matrix models. We’ll take a model <me>P_{t+1}=M P_t,</me> for now we
will think of <m>M</m> as a matrix and <m>P_t</m> as a vector. </p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="per-capita-production-and-nonlinear-effects">
<title>per capita production and nonlinear effects</title>

<p> So far our model has roughly been, <me>N_{t+1}=r N_t,</me> or
<me>P_{t+1}=M P_{t},</me> where <m>N_t</m> and <m>r</m> are scalars, or
<m>P_t</m> is a vector and <m>M</m> is a matrix. </p>


<p> As an example of a 1D model, our linear model assumes that
<me>\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}=r,</me> or the ratio of current population to
previous population is <m>r</m>, no matter the size of the previous
generation. Instead, we might expect that, for a variety of reasons
(like space, food, aggression, or lack of resources) this ratio
decreases as the current population size increases. Mathematically, this
requires <m>r=r(N_t)</m>. </p>

<p> In words, small populations are capable of large increases from one
generation to the next. But, large populations might only increase by
slight amounts over generations. In fact, really large populations might
actually shrink. The comparison of linear and nonlinear models is given
in <xref ref="fig-pcp" />. </p>

<figure xml:id="fig-pcp"> 
<image source="./images/lin_nonlin_pcp.png" width="50%"/>
<caption>Per capita
production plots. Left) Generation to generation change independent of
population size, Right) change dependent on population size for three
famous models of <sq>density dependence</sq>.</caption> </figure>


<p> Notice the peculiarity of the black line (or curve) in the right
panel of <xref ref="fig-pcp" />(or <xref ref="fig-nonlin-upd"/>).
It quite happily <sq>goes negative</sq>, which means for an initially
large enough population, the subsequent generation is multiplied by a
negative number. Simply stated, that is weird. Fortunately, our other
models circumvent this problem by requiring <m>p.c.p.&gt;0</m> at all
population sizes. </p>


<p> Multiplying <m>p.c.p</m> by population size <m>N_t</m> gives our
updating function, <m>f(N_t)=(p.c.p.)\times N_t</m>. Then, our model is
<me>N_{t+1}=f(N_t)=(p.c.p.)\times N_t.</me> Some sample updating
functions are plotted in <xref ref="fig-upd" />. Notice that there
are some major qualitative changes when we compare the line in the left
panel to any of the curves in the right panel. Most importantly, the
updating function intersects the resetting line more than once. Again,
these intersections suggest that <me>N_{t+1}=N_t=N^*.</me> Recalling our
previous notation and definitions, these nonlinear models possess
multiple equilibria! </p>

<title>Ricker Model</title>
<p>
We now consider a population <m>G_t</m>, which is the number of guppies
living in a bowl on our desk. For simplicity, we will assume that we
start with a female guppy who is gravid. Guppies are fascinating
creatures that can spawn indefinitely after mating once. We’ll ignore
the fact that she gives birth to males and females, so that <sq>number
of guppies</sq> above actually means ‘number of <em>female</em> guppies.
</p> <p> Guppies are fascinating, but cruel - they are quite happy to
eat each other. It’s hard to track, but we know that as the guppy tank
fills we see fewer baby guppies (i.e., per capita production drops as in <xref ref="fig-pcp"/>). For a model of guppy dynamics, we will
assume <me>G_{t+1}=rG_t e^{-kG_t}.</me> This model has been sketched
above in the green curves of <xref ref="fig-pcp" /> and <xref ref="fig-nonlin-upd" />. </p>

<p> For a particular choice of parameters we find the following diagram
and iterated solution. </p>
<figure xml:id="fig-f3">
 <image source="./images/f3.png" width="50%"/>
<caption>Cobwebbing diagram and iterated solution for <m>r=3.7</m>,
<m>k=0.15</m>. Left) Updating function and cobwebbing, Right) Iterated
solution.</caption> </figure>


<p> It appears that these solutions converge to a value
<m>G^*\approx8.4</m> guppies. Can we do better than this guess? We know
that our equilibrium satisfies, <me>\begin{aligned} G^*&amp;=rG^*
e^{-kG^*}\\ 1&amp;=r e^{-kG^*}\\ e^{kG^*}&amp;=r \\ kG^*&amp;=\ln r \\
G^*&amp;=\frac{\ln r }{k}\end{aligned}</me> Immediately, we should see a
few things. First <m>G^*=0</m> is always a solution to the first
equation. Ignoring that, for <m>k&gt;0</m>, we have a positive
equilibrium only when <m>r&gt;1</m> so that the logarithm is positive.
We now know that for <m>r=3.7, k=0.15</m>, <m>G^*\approx8.722</m>. </p>


<p> Depending on the intrinsic growth rate <m>r</m> (<term>rmax</term>
in the code) of our guppies, we might see oscillatory or non-oscillatory
approaches to equilibria. The solution generated by the black updating
function (with <m>r=1</m>) approaches <m>G^*=0</m> (i.e., it has no
<sq>nontrivial</sq> equilibrium point). Looking again at <xref
ref="fig-f3-rmax"
/>, try to uncover a relationship between the tendency of the
trajectory to oscillate (right panel) and the crossing point of the
updating function and resetting line (left panel). </p>
