<title>Disclaimer.</title> <p> These
notes were originally written for MATH 056 at Swarthmore College and
subsequently quite heavily modifited for courses taught at the
University of Central Oklahoma. This course was developed and taught as
MATH 056 in Fall 2011, and subsequently as MATH 4910/5910 in the Spring
of 2013, 2015, and 2017. These notes were inspired by a course that I
took as a first year graduate student at the University of Utah which
was taught by Fred Adler. </p> <p> Additional references used in the
development of these notes (unfortunately at this point in time uncited
within the text) are listed on the last page. </p> <p> The structure of
these notes might be jarring, but the goal is to facilitate rapid entry
to inspired, independent investigations of interesting questions. Often
books begin with discrete-time mathematical models (which are
conceptually and mathematically interesting, but not of interest to most
students), then spend a bit of time in one- and two-dimensional,
continuous-time models (which are familiar and interesting, but time
consuming and of limited applicability in many ’real-world’ situations).
The goal here is introduce a few broad ideas of mathematical modeling
and to take an early look at stochastic processes and to introduce
modeling that scales to higher dimensional problems. Both of these
approaches rely quite heavily on numerical tools. </p> <p> Please write
