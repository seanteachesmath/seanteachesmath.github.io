Consider a mild infection circulating among members of a population, where the
<sq>healthy</sq> individuals are susceptible to the infection (<m>S</m>) and the
<sq>infectious</sq> individuals are capable of transmitting the infection to others
(<m>I</m>).

<p>
Much like in class we will build a word model as we go.
<me>\begin{aligned}
\text{change in }S &amp; = +\text{(gain from recovery)} - \text{(loss to infection)}\\
\text{change in }I &amp; = +\text{(gain from infection)} - \text{(loss to recovery)},
\end{aligned}</me> and replace
the terms with symbols. Our <sq>first</sq> term is <sq>loss to
recovery</sq> in the <m>I</m> equation. We can think of <m>\gamma</m> as
the leaving rate from the <m>I</m> compartment, much like <m>m</m> was
the <sq>leaving rate from the living</sq> (i.e., dying) compartment of a
population model. Everything, in this model, that leaves one compartment
enters another (i.e., there are no <sq>leaks</sq>). We can also argue
for the infection rate as follows, since infection is only transmitted
directly and by infectious hosts, we might expect that the rate that
<m>S</m> individuals gain infection is proportional to the density
(individuals per hectare) of infectious individuals, <m>I</m>. In fact here, we
assume that the infection rate is a linearly increasing function of
<m>I</m>. There are plenty of other models of transmission, some we will
study in the homework, others later in the semester, still more in our
projects. 
</p>


<p>
<me>\begin{aligned}
 \text{change in }S &amp; = +\text{(gain from recovery)} &amp;&amp;-\text{(loss to infection)}\\
\frac{dS}{dt}&amp;= + \gamma I &amp;&amp; - {\beta I} S\\
\text{change in }I &amp; =  + \text{(gain from infection)}&amp;&amp; -\text{(loss to recovery)}\\
\frac{dI}{dt}&amp;= + \beta IS &amp;&amp; -{\gamma} I
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
Since the total number* of individuals <m>N</m> is preserved, we can
replace the equation for <m>S</m> by an algebraic constraint
<m>S=N-I</m>. We can substitute this into the equation for <m>I</m> and
derive a 1-dimensional, nonlinear model,<me>\frac{d^{} {I}}{d
{t}^{}}=\beta I (N-I)-\gamma I.</me> If we define our model
<m>h(I)=\beta I (N-I)-\gamma I,</m> we can plot the more interesting
version of our phase line as in <xref ref="fig-phase" />. Ignoring
graphs for the moment, we can also compute equilibria of continuous time
models, <term>defined as</term> solutions to <m>h(I^*)=0</m>. This gives
<m>I^*=0</m> and <m>I^*=N-\frac{\gamma}{\beta}.</m> It might prove
useful to notice that our nontrivial solution exists when
<m>\gamma&lt;\beta N</m> this suggests a limitation on the recovery rate
that depends on the contact parameter <m>\beta</m> and the total population size <m>N</m>.

<p>
Consider the model <me>\begin{aligned} \frac{d^{} {N}}{d
{t}^{}}&amp;=\left(r\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)-\frac
{hF}{1+sN}\right)N\\ &amp;= (f(N)-g(N))N,\end{aligned}</me> that
describes the dynamics of a logistically-growing population subjected to
harvesting. Equilibria of this model are <m>N^*</m> and
<m>f(N^*)=g(N^*)</m>. The removal rate due to harvesting is
<me>\frac{hF}{1+sN},</me> per <m>N</m>. One short derivation of this
functional form is given here, we will see another derivation in a few
lectures. 
</p>

<paragraphs xml:id="derivation-of-a-functional-response">

<title>Derivation of a functional response</title> 
<p>
A harvester
spends its time, of which it has <m>T</m>, searching (<m>T_S</m>) or
handling (<m>T_H</m>), thus, <me>T=T_S+T_H.</me> The handling time
depends on the number of prey captured (<m>N_C</m>) and the handling
time per prey (<m>\hat s</m>), so that, <me>T_H=\hat s N_C.</me> In
turn, the number captured depends on the searching or finding rate
(<m>\hat h</m>), the number of prey available (<m>N</m>), and the time
spend searching by predators or harvesters (<m>T_S</m>), <me>N_C=\hat h
N T_S.</me> Solving for the search time, <me>T_S=\frac{N_C}{\hat h
N},</me> so that <me>T=T_S+T_H=\hat s N_C+\frac{N_C}{\hat h N}=
N_C\left(\hat s + \frac{1}{\hat h N}\right).</me> Solving for
<m>N_C</m>, <me>N_C=T\left(\frac{\hat h N}{1+\hat s \hat h
N}\right).</me> 
</p> 
<p>
The per predator feeding rate is,
<me>\frac{N_C}{T}=\left(\frac{\hat h N}{1+\hat s \hat h N}\right),</me>
since the definition of <m>T</m> was <sq>per predator</sq>. Redefining
constants <m>h=\hat h</m> and <m>s=\hat s \hat h</m>, we can finally
write the per predator harvesting rate as
<me>\frac{N_C}{T}=h_{II}(N)=\left(\frac{h N}{1+ s N}\right),</me> so
that the harvesting term is <m>h_{II}(N)F.</m> If predators
instantaneously consume their prey, <m>s=0</m> which returns the Type I
response, because saturation vanishes.

<section xml:id="two-dim-ecology">
<title>Two dimensional models in ecology</title>
<p>
Consider now, a two
dimensional extension where <m>F</m> is no longer a parameter, but
instead a dynamic variable. Whose growth is proportional to the
consumption of prey, up to a scaling factor <m>\epsilon</m>. Such a
model is, <me>\begin{aligned} 
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d{t}^{}}&amp;=\left(r\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)-\frac{hF}{1+sN}\right)N\\ 
\frac{d^{} {F}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\frac{\epsilon hFN}{1+sN}-mF.
\end{aligned}</me> We can give ourselves a slightly
simpler situation if we assume that the predator is a <sq>Type I</sq>
predator, <me>\begin{aligned} 
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d
{t}^{}}&amp;=\left(r\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)- hF\right)N\\
 \frac{d^{}{F}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\epsilon hFN-mF.
 \end{aligned}</me> A common approach
to studying such a model is to first <sq>nondimensionalize</sq> the
variables by scaling by some relevant value. Here we have a carrying
capacity for <m>N</m>, so if we scale <m>N</m> by <m>K</m> we can define
<m>x=\frac{N}{K},</m> and study the dynamics of <m>x</m> which describes
the proportion of carrying capacity that is filled. The goal of this is
to combine parameters and reduce the dimension of parameter space. We
also rescale time by setting <m>T=rt</m> and replacing the derivative
<m>\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {}}{d {t}^{}}</m> by <m>\displaystyle
r\frac{d^{} {}}{d {T}^{}}</m>. The definition involving <m>F</m> is less
clear from the start, but as we step through the process we find that
using <m>\displaystyle y=\frac{h}{r}F</m> works pretty well. Ultimately,
after some failed attempts, we find something like, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {x}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\left(\left(1-x\right)-y\right)x\\
\frac{d^{} {y}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\beta(x-\alpha)y.\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>

<p>
Just as we used phase lines in one dimension, we will use phase
planes in two dimensions. To introduce this process we will use an even
simpler model describing the densities of prey (<m>X</m>) and predator
(<m>Y</m>), <me>\begin{aligned}
 \frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=rX-mXY\\
\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=nXY-sY.
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p> 

<p>
First,
we hope to compute equilibria. We can start by solving when each of the
equations is equal to zero (i.e., when individual quantities are
unchanging). Setting <me>\frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}=0\Rightarrow
(r-mY)X=0.</me> This equation implies that <m>X</m> is unchanging along
the lines <m>X=0</m> and <m>Y=\frac{r}{m}</m> in the <m>(X,
Y)</m>-plane. Additionally, setting <me>\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d
{t}^{}}=0\Rightarrow (nX-s)Y=0.</me> This equation implies that <m>Y</m>
is unchanging along the lines <m>Y=0</m> and <m>X=\frac{s}{n}</m> in the
<m>(X, Y)</m>-plane. Equilibria require both equations be satisfied
simultaneously, thus opposite nullclines must intersect so that
<em>both</em> of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are unchanging. We will jump
ahead and plot <em>everything</em> in <xref ref="fig-pred-prey-pp"
/>, this includes trajectories in the phase plane and <sq>direction
arrows.</sq> 
</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-pred-prey-pp">
<image source="./images/pred_X.png"  width="50%"/>
<caption>On lines <m>\frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}=0</m>, motion is in the vertical
direction. On lines <m>\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d {t}^{}}=0</m>, motion is in the
horizontal direction. </caption> </figure> 

<p>
Direction arrows in <xref ref="fig-pred-prey-pp" />, are obtained by treating the
individual differential equations as inequalities. The motivation is
that we know that <me>\frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}&gt;0</me> when
<me>(r-mY)X&gt;0.</me> Since <m>X&gt;0</m> is of interest, the to ensure
the derivative is positive, we need <me>\frac{r}{m}&gt;Y.</me> Thus,
<m>X</m> is increasing below the (nonzero) <m>X</m>-nullcline.
Similarly, <m>X</m> is decreasing above this nullcline. Lastly, we can
show that <m>Y</m> is decreasing <sq>to the left</sq> of the (again,
nonzero) vertical <m>Y</m>-nullcline, and decreasing to the right. This
shows that motion is counterclockwise. Numerical solutions show that we
have closed orbits around the equilibrium point <m>(X^*, Y^*)</m>. We
call this point <em>neutrally stable</em>. 
</p> 
<p>
If we hadn’t
computed solutions, we wouldn’t necessarily know from the phase portrait
that these solutions do not spiral in towards or out from the
equilibrium. To know for certain, we would need to study the
<sq>linearized</sq> dynamics near each equilibrium point, including the
point <m>(0, 0)</m>, as well. Since we have solutions, we might as well
plot them in time (see <xref ref="fig-pred-prey" />).

<title>The <sq>Trace-Determinant Method</sq></title>

<paragraphs xml:id="diagnostics-for-eigenvalues-and-stability">

<title>Diagnostics for eigenvalues and stability</title>


<p>
In many cases, the calculation of eigenvalues from the Jacobian
matrix at equilibria is unnecessary. Instead, we prefer a simpler
approach that we refer to as the <sq>trace-determinant method.</sq>
Combined with a cautious sketch of the phase plane, the inspection of
<m>\tau=\operatorname{Tr}{J^*}</m> and
<m>\Delta=\operatorname{det}{J^*}.</m> 
</p>


<p>
In some situations, the phase plan suggests that trajectories might
oscillate about a fixed point. Yet, without the aid of computers we are
often unable to distinguish between equilibria that attract, repel, or
do neither. We call these attracting (repelling) equilibria stable
(unstable) foci, the plural of focus, or neutrally stable centers, in
the third case. Since we expect solutions to oscillate given the phase
plane, all that remains is to determine whether or not the real part of
the eigenvalue is positive, negative, or zero. This is <em>obvious</em>
from the sign of <m>\tau</m>. The eigenvalues corresponding to the
characteristic polynomial <me>C(\lambda)=\lambda^2-\tau \lambda
+\Delta,</me> are given by
<me>\lambda_\pm=\frac{\tau}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{\tau^2- 4\Delta}}{2}.</me>
We can see that <m>\tau&gt;0</m> implies
<m>\operatorname{Re}(\lambda)&gt;0</m>, which means perturbations from
equilibria decay and a particular equilibrium is a stable focus. We can
repeat the argument for <m>\tau&lt;0</m>, which suggests an unstable
focus, characterized by growing oscillations. Eigenvalues are purely
imaginary, giving rise to neutrally stable centers, if <m>\tau=0</m>.
Thus, if we expect oscillations, <m>\tau</m> tells us whether
oscillations grow (<m>\tau&gt;0</m>), decay (<m>\tau&lt;0</m>), or are
sustained (<m>\tau=0</m>), all without ever calculating the actual
eigenvalue. 
</p>


<p>
Another interesting case, that gives us yet another <em>obvious</em>
conclusion, is <m>\Delta&lt;0</m>. If we consider a matrix, <m>J^*</m>,
then <m>\tau</m> is the sum of its eigenvalues while <m>\Delta</m> is
the product. Thus, for a <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m>J^*</m>,
<m>\Delta=\lambda_1\lambda_2.</m> If <m>\Delta&lt;0</m>, then
eigenvalues must be of opposite sign. This gives rise the the dynamics
of a saddle point, stable in one direction, unstable in the other. 
</p>


<p>
The only other nondegenerate cases occur when we have distinct, real
eigenvalues of the same sign. The corresponding equilibria are termed
nodes, with stability governed by the sign of <m>\tau</m>, since
<m>\Delta&gt;0</m>. 
</p>


<p>
We have our degenerate cases on the <m>\Delta=0</m> axis and along
the curve <m>\Delta=\frac{\tau^2}{4}</m>. The case <m>\Delta=0</m> gives
us a line of fixed points, where one quantity remains fixed (since one
eigenvalue is zero) while the other grows from (<m>\tau&gt;0</m>) or
decays towards (<m>\tau&lt;0</m>) zero. Along the curve
<m>\Delta=\frac{\tau^2}{4}</m> equilibria are called <sq>degenerate
nodes,</sq> characterized by a repeated eigenvalue. 
</p>


<p>
Stable points, which attract trajectories, are often called
<sq>sinks.</sq> Unstable points, which repel trajectories, are often
called <sq>sources,</sq> since solutions emanate from such a source.

<title>Method</title>


<p>
To review, we apply the following method to study 2D nonlinear
dynamical systems. 
</p>


<p>

<li> <p> Read and interpret the model (dimensional analysis of parameters. </p> </li> 
<li> <p> Compute nullclines and equilibria. </p> </li>

<li> <p> Refine knowledge of stability with linearization via Jacobian. </p> </li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
Consider two species <m>A(t)</m> and <m>B(t)</m> for ants and
beetles, respectively. Assume that each grows (in the absence of the
other) according to logistic growth, <me>
\begin{aligned}
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {A}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=r_A A\Big(1-\frac{A}{K_A}\Big)\\[10pt] 
\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {B}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=r_B B\Big(1-\frac{B}{K_B}\Big).
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}</me> Here, each species grows independently of
the other. Beetles have no effect on ants; ants have no effect on
beetles. Our mechanism for interaction will be <em>interference</em>
competition, which leads in increased mortality. <me>\begin{aligned}
\begin{cases} \displaystyle\frac{d^{} {A}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=r_A
A\Big(1-\frac{A}{K_A}-\frac{\alpha B}{K_A}\Big)\\[10pt]
\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {B}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=r_B
B\Big(1-\frac{B}{K_B}-\frac{\gamma A}{K_B}\Big).
\end{cases}\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
To understand interspecific competition, we need to understand the
units and magnitude of <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\gamma</m>. Roughly,
<m>\alpha</m> translates from units of beetle density to an <q>effective
ant density.</q> According to the ratio <m>\frac{B}{K_A}</m>, beetles
<sq>fill</sq> some of the carrying capacity allotted to ants. Just how
much of the capacity that they fill is given by the parameter
<m>\alpha</m>, which when multiplied by <m>B</m> gives the <sq>ant
equivalency</sq> of <m>B</m> beetles. We will look more closely at the
equation for <m>B</m>, but note that we could make similar observations
about the equation for <m>A</m>. 
</p>


<p>
The dynamics of <m>B</m> are given by, <me>\frac{d^{} {B}}{d
{t}^{}}=r_B B\Big(1-\frac{B+\gamma A}{K_B}\Big),</me> which slightly
more directly illustrates that both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> fill the
carrying capacity allotted to <m>B</m>. In one dimension, equilibria
depend on the zeros of the right hand side of an equation like this. In
two dimensions, equilibria depend on the values of both quantities
<m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. The first step, as before, is to compute the
nullclines for <m>B</m>. Setting <m>\frac{d^{} {B}}{d {t}^{}}=0</m>
implies that either <m>B=0</m> or <me>1-\frac{B+\gamma A}{K_B}=0.</me>
With a single species, this equation looks like
<me>1-\frac{\text{animals}}{K_B}=0.</me> We can solve this equation for
the density of animals at equilibrium to find,
<me>\text{animals}=K_B.</me> But we know that we have a particular
composition of animals, such that <me>\text{animals}=B+\gamma A.</me>
Combining these equations, <me>K_B=B+\gamma A,</me> gives <m>B</m> as a
function of <m>A</m>, the abundance of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that
guarantee that <m>B</m> is unchanging,<me>B=K_B -\gamma A.</me> 
</p>


<p>
Finally, we have that, if either or . By their definition, on , the
motion in the <m>B</m> direction is zero, and dynamics are strictly
increasing (or decreasing) in <m>A</m>. 
</p>


<p>
Similarly, we can compute that, if either or . By their definition,
on , the motion in the <m>A</m> direction is zero, and dynamics are
strictly increasing (or decreasing) in <m>B</m>. We have to consider a
variety of parameter combinations and relative magnitudes. This lets us
plot four distinct phase portraits, shown in <xref ref="fig-compet-A-only"/> - <xref ref="fig-compet-saddle" />

<title>Predator - Prey equations</title>


<p>
Consider the densities of prey (<m>X</m>) and its predator
(<m>Y</m>), given by the following (slightly incorrect, or at least
misleading equations), <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=rX-sXY\\ 
\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=sXY-qY.
\end{aligned}</me> The interaction term, <m>sXY</m>,
is the term that we focus on. This term represents predation in the
<m>\frac{d^{} {X}}{d {t}^{}}</m>-equation, but growth in the
<m>\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d {t}^{}}</m>-equation <!-->(see units diagram)-->. 
</p>

<!--table-->


<p>
Indeed, <m>sXY</m> describes the rate of predation on <m>X</m>, but
it cannot describe, as it is now, the growth rate of <m>Y</m>. The
unit’s in the second equation are inconsistent, thus, the model must be
wrong! In fact, we have <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {X}}{d{t}^{}}&amp;=rX-sXY\\ 
\frac{d^{} {Y}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\varepsilon sXY-qY,
\end{aligned}</me> where <me>\varepsilon\sim\frac{\text{predator}}{\text{prey}},</me> is some (probably small) number describing the
<sq>conversion efficiency</sq> of producing new predators from consumed
prey.

<title>Michaelis-Menten kinetics</title>

<introduction>
<p>
The introduction to units will highlight the <sq>fact</sq> that
units in reaction kinetics are somewhat less tangible and slightly more
difficult to interpret. We will study the dynamics of cell receptors
(<m>X_0, X_1</m>) as they shuttle extracellular nutrients (<m>N</m>)
into the cell. We denote the concentration of cellular nutrient by
<m>C</m>. 
</p>
</introduction>

<p>
We wish to apply the <sq>law of mass action</sq> which simply
states, 
</p>


<p>
<em>in a bimolecular reaction, the reaction rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of reactants</em>.

</p>


<p>
Assuming that <m>[A]</m> and <m>[B]</m> are the concentrations of
reactants, <me>\begin{aligned} \text{rate}&amp;\propto [A][B]\\
&amp;=k[A][B],\end{aligned}</me> where the constant of proportionality,
<m>k</m>, is called the <sq>rate constant.</sq> 
</p>


<p>
Since the law of mass action relies on concentrations of reactants,
we must reconsider our receptors and nutrients in terms of
<sq>concentrations</sq>. For a given cellular component <m>Z</m>, the
<sq>volumetric concentration of <m>Z</m></sq> is,
<me>\left[\text{concentration}\atop{\text{of }Z}\right]=\left[\text{average number}\atop{\text{of}~Z~\text{per cell}}\right]\times\left[\text{average number of}\atop\text{cells per volume}\right].</me> Treating
<m>N</m>, <m>X_0</m>, <m>X_1</m>, and <m>C</m> as volumetric
concentrations we can use the reaction diagram (<xref ref="fig-nutrient-recept" />) to build differential equations to
describe the changes in concentrations. 
</p>


<figure xml:id="fig-nutrient-recept">
<caption>INSERT REACTION </caption>
</figure>


<p>
As an example, there are two ways that the extracellular nutrient
concentration changes giving two terms to the <m>\frac{d^{} {N}}{d
{t}^{}}</m> equation. <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -\left(\text{losses when free nutrient binds to empty receptor}\right)\\
&amp;\qquad +\left(\text{gains when occupied receptors release nutrient extracellularly}\right)\\
&amp; = -k_+ N X_0+ k_- X_1
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
Similarly, we can add the remaining equations, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N X_0 + k_- X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_0}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N X_0 + k_- X_1 + k_i X_i\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N X_0 - k_- X_1 - k_i X_i\\ 
\frac{d^{}{C}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_i X_1
\end{aligned}</me> Given this model, our
first goal is to make some simplifications through astute observations.
Both <m>X_0</m> and <m>X_1</m> are receptor states, and if we add the
two differential equations, <me>\frac{d^{} {X_0}}{d {t}^{}}+\frac{d^{}
{X_1}}{d {t}^{}}=0,</me> we see that the total receptor concentration is
conserved, <m>R</m>. With this we can write <m>X_0=R-X_1.</m>
<me>\begin{aligned} 
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N (R-X_1) +k_- X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{} {X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N (R-X_1) - k_- X_1 -k_i X_i
\end{aligned}</me> Reshuffling a bit, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = -k_+ N R+(k_+N + k_-) X_1\\ 
\frac{d^{}{X_1}}{d {t}^{}} &amp; = k_+ N R- (k_+ N + k_- + k_i)X_i
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>


<p>
We can study these equations in the phase plane. Assuming all
parameters are positive, both nullclines saturate to a value
<m>X_1\rightarrow R</m> at large <m>N</m>. Knowing very little about
parameters, we know that the half saturation constant of the <m>X_1</m>
nullcline is larger than that of the <m>N</m> nullcline. The nullclines,
direction arrows on the nullclines, and a sample trajectory are
illustrated in <xref ref="fig-mm-kinetics" />.

Following on the heels of the quasi-steady
state assumption, we will close with an application of fast and slow
dynamics that arises in mathematical models of neurons.

This example, called the FitzHugh-Nagumo model allows us to synthesize much
of the material from continuous time dynamical systems: phase plane,
equilibria, analysis, and approximation.
