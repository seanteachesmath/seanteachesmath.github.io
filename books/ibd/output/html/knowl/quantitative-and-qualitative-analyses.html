<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Trained as mathematicians, we are much more likely to be familiar with exact or ‘quantitative’ approaches, methods, or solutions. In particular, when we imagine the solution to a particular problem we are likely to expect</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">a specific formula, or</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">a specific numerical value</p></li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Despite this, there is much room for ‘qualitative’ or more descriptive approaches, methods, or solutions. In particular, through development and analysis of mathematical models we want to gain an appreciation for qualitative (graphical) solutions. To compare the two, we will outline potential pros and cons, or strengths and drawbacks. But, as one develops experience, what once may have seemed like a drawback might begin to look more and more like a strength of a particular approach.</p>
<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Drawbacks of qualitative analysis.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Perhaps the biggest drawback of qualitative methods is that we are really limited to applying these approaches to models of lower dimension. These methods work well for models of 1 or 2 dimensions (i.e., variables). Occasionally we are lucky enough to have opportunities to view higher dimensional systems in lower dimension by clever analysis techniques, so we can stretch the territory of qualitative methods a bit in some cases. We are able to get <em class="emphasis">only</em> broad information about our solutions or the behaviors of our model<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. We could distinguish between</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">oscillations or not, or</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">growth or decay</p></li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">and identify conditions under which these behaviors occur.</p></article><article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Strengths of qualitative analysis.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Qualitative analysis requires minimal assumptions about the numerical values for rates (parameters), which in many cases are hard to find, especially at the beginning of a project. This analysis can also help give information about interesting relationships between parameters. In particular, based on the discussion above, understanding under which parameters oscillations occur or not, or under which parameters solutions grow or decay, is powerful information.</p></article><article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Drawbacks of quantitative analysis.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Counter to our intuition, ‘closed form’ solutions to interesting models are often impossible to find or are uselessly complex when found. If we seek numerical solutions or graphs of analytical solutions, we need precise numerical values for initial conditions and parameters. For example, when applying our qualitative methods to our emigration model, we found that \(N^* =
\dfrac{g}{r}\text{.}\) This analysis require little, if any, assumptions on \(g\) and \(r\) other than that they were ‘some positive values.’</p></article><article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Strengths of quantitative analysis.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Sometimes we get lucky and models are solvable and solutions provide intuition. In other cases, even ‘good guesses’ of parameter values can help generate “intuition building”’ numerical results about the model and its dynamics.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="introduction.html#quantitative-and-qualitative-analyses">in-context</a></span>
