<p>Much like in class we will build a word model as we go.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned} \text{change in }S &amp;
= \text{gain from recovery} - \text{loss to
infection}\\ \text{change in }I &amp; = \text{loss
to recovery} + \text{gain from
infection},\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">and replace the terms with symbols. Our ‘first’ term is ‘loss to recovery’ in the \(I\) equation. We can think of \(\gamma\) as the leaving rate from the \(I\) compartment, much like \(m\) was the ‘leaving rate from the living’ (i.e., dying) compartment of a population model. Everything, in this model, that leaves one compartment enters another (i.e., there are no ‘leaks’). We can also argue for the infection rate as follows, since infection is only transmitted directly and by infectious hosts, we might expect that the rate that \(S\) individuals gain infection is proportional to the density (zombies per hectare) of infectious zombies, \(I\text{.}\) In fact here, we assume that the infection rate is a linearly increasing function of \(I\text{.}\) There are plenty of other models of transmission, some we will study in the homework, others later in the semester, still more in our projects.</p>
