<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In many cases, the calculation of eigenvalues from the Jacobian matrix at equilibria is unnecessary. Instead, we prefer a simpler approach that we refer to as the ‘trace-determinant method.’ Combined with a cautious sketch of the phase plane, the inspection of \(\tau=\operatorname{Tr}{J^*}\) and \(\Delta=\operatorname{det}{J^*}.\)</p>
<p>In some situations, the phase plan suggests that trajectories might oscillate about a fixed point. Yet, without the aid of computers we are often unable to distinguish between equilibria that attract, repel, or do neither. We call these attracting (repelling) equilibria stable (unstable) foci, the plural of focus, or neutrally stable centers, in the third case. Since we expect solutions to oscillate given the phase plane, all that remains is to determine whether or not the real part of the eigenvalue is positive, negative, or zero. This is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">obvious</em> from the sign of \(\tau\text{.}\) The eigenvalues corresponding to the characteristic polynomial</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C(\lambda)=\lambda^2-\tau \lambda
+\Delta,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">are given by</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_\pm=\frac{\tau}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{\tau^2- 4\Delta}}{2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We can see that \(\tau&gt;0\) implies \(\operatorname{Re}(\lambda)&gt;0\text{,}\) which means perturbations from equilibria decay and a particular equilibrium is a stable focus. We can repeat the argument for \(\tau&lt;0\text{,}\) which suggests an unstable focus, characterized by growing oscillations. Eigenvalues are purely imaginary, giving rise to neutrally stable centers, if \(\tau=0\text{.}\) Thus, if we expect oscillations, \(\tau\) tells us whether oscillations grow (\(\tau&gt;0\)), decay (\(\tau&lt;0\)), or are sustained (\(\tau=0\)), all without ever calculating the actual eigenvalue.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Another interesting case, that gives us yet another <em class="emphasis">obvious</em> conclusion, is \(\Delta&lt;0\text{.}\) If we consider a matrix, \(J^*\text{,}\) then \(\tau\) is the sum of its eigenvalues while \(\Delta\) is the product. Thus, for a \(2\times2\) matrix \(J^*\text{,}\) \(\Delta=\lambda_1\lambda_2.\) If \(\Delta&lt;0\text{,}\) then eigenvalues must be of opposite sign. This gives rise the the dynamics of a saddle point, stable in one direction, unstable in the other.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The only other nondegenerate cases occur when we have distinct, real eigenvalues of the same sign. The corresponding equilibria are termed nodes, with stability governed by the sign of \(\tau\text{,}\) since \(\Delta&gt;0\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have our degenerate cases on the \(\Delta=0\) axis and along the curve \(\Delta=\frac{\tau^2}{4}\text{.}\) The case \(\Delta=0\) gives us a line of fixed points, where one quantity remains fixed (since one eigenvalue is zero) while the other grows from (\(\tau&gt;0\)) or decays towards (\(\tau&lt;0\)) zero. Along the curve \(\Delta=\frac{\tau^2}{4}\) equilibria are called ‘degenerate nodes,’ characterized by a repeated eigenvalue.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Stable points, which attract trajectories, are often called ‘sinks.’ Unstable points, which repel trajectories, are often called ‘sources,’ since solutions emanate from such a source.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="the-trace-determinant-method.html#diagnostics-for-eigenvalues-and-stability">in-context</a></span>
