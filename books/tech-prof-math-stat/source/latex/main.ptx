<title>Preview</title>

<p>Our plan is to introduce the main objectives of the
class (i.e., syllabus and goals). We will test <latex/> by opening a blank document and
building up features based on classroom requests.

<title>Review</title>

<p>We did some of our work using accounts on <url
href="https:://www.overleaf.com"/>.</p>

<p>With software (in this case Overleaf) in hand, we opened a mostly blank document, 
set up the main structure of the document,
and practiced typing text and compiling. In the main structure we set the
document class, began the document, and added content to the preamble to generate title 
page information.

<p>The following links will help you install the appropriate software for your computer.
The interface <idx>TeXworks</idx> Software
interface, TeXWorks on <url
href="https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases">
Windows OS (link)</url> <idx> OS , Windows</idx> computers
<em>additionally</em> Windows users will need to install an
<em>engine</em> either TeXLive <url href="https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe">(link)</url> 
<idx> Software engine , TexLive</idx> or MikTeX
<idx>Software engine , MiKTeX </idx><url href="https://miktex.org/download/ctan/systems/win32/miktex/setup/windows-x64/basic-miktex-21.6-x64.exe">(link)</url>. You will want to plug your computer in, turn
off any antivirus software (these are safe programs), and give yourself
plenty of time for the downloads. Things are a bit easier on Mac OS, we
use TeXshop  <idx> Software interface , TeXshop</idx> that comes from
the MacTeX <idx> Software engine , MacTeX installer</idx> on <url
href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html">Mac OS

</p>

<p>There are plenty of other options, take some time to explore and find a configuration you enjoy using.</p>
