PTX:ERROR:   a cross-reference ("xref") uses references [fig::bibtexreed] that do not point to any target.  Maybe you typed an @xml:id value wrong, maybe the target of the @xml:id is nonexistent, or maybe you temporarily removed the target from your source.  Your output will contain some placeholder text that you will not want to distribute to your readers.

MBX:WARNING: There are apparent XML elements in locations that should be text only (2 times).
MBX:WARNING: There is an apparent XML element (<latex>) inside an <c> element, which should only contain text.  Using an escaped "less than" ('&lt;') might be the solution, or using a CDATA section.

MBX:DEPRECATE: (2019-06-28) the "table" element needs a "title", not a "caption".  An existing "caption" will be used instead.  Both will display below the "tabular" (1 time)
