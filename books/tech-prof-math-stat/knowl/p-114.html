<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Today in class we learned how to use R to program Riemann Sums. We first picked a function to work with and assign to \(f\text{,}\) and we assigned values to \(a, b, n, dx\text{,}\) and also the \(area\text{.}\) We made \(dx\) equal to \((b-a)/n\text{.}\) We then computed the area using the left hand method and the equation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">area &lt;- area
+ dx*(f(a))</code> then <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">area &lt;- area + dx*f(a+1*dx)</code> and so on for each of the 5 rectangles we computed. After we did that we learned how draw rectangles onto our graph using the polygon command. I found this part of the programming to be a bit difficult because it was kind of confusing knowing what data to put into to the command to give you the rectangle shape you want. After messing with that command for a bit we came back to finding the area of the rectangles, but this time using a for loop, and a bigger value of \(N\text{.}\) We also used the for loop to draw our rectangles for all values in 1:N using the polygon command. We ended up with 10 rectangles on our graph. We then finally learned how to make it into a function. We made <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rectangles</code> into a function of \(x\) incorporating the for loop we had just made.This allows us to just be able to type \(rectangles(a, b, N)\) with numbers assigned to \(a, b,\) and \(N\) and it give us the same information we had been computing but with less work.</p>
