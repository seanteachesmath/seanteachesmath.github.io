<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We learned today that we’ll be building our own textbook for this class as we advance through the semester. We’ll learn the some of the basic coding techniques of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sage</code>, and <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> in this class, and I’ve got to say I’m a little nervous about that - just today we learned a bunch of things which I’m sure will be important later. Typing the “percent” symbol in a line of code, for example, hides the line from that point forward so we can make notes to ourselves (and the professor, I imagine). This will be incredibly useful (for me, at least) to learn as we go. We found that “backslash”  slash is going to be used a lot, and I only used “forward slash” in its place like ...five times , (I’ve yet to master the art of staring at a compile-error screen students , {\<span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>} , errors with dignity ... it’s mostly confusing to me, still) We learned how to make a title, a new page, sections and sections, and a couple math commands to make symbols such as integrals. I feel like the most important thing we learned today is having a begin(ning) and an end to just about all of our commands. The commands can be manipulated, like math equations, but it is clear that they follow very strict rules - evidenced by my many, many failed attempts at compiling integrals , And if anybody is curious, the “and” symbol does something weird and prevents compiling...must investigate further. Great first day , I imagine this will prove to be a very stimulating class.</p>
