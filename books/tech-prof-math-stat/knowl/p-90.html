<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">During the beginning of class we created a spreadsheet for our debate projects. We wrote down the topics of debate and who would be arguing them. After everyone had written down their topic, we created a separate spreadsheet with information to be used later in the new program we are learning, “R.” In R we learned how to code and calculate functions such as logarithms and integrals. We were also able to command the program to generate a graph of the second spreadsheet we made, and we learned how to change the plotted symbols and colors of the graph.</p>
