<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It might seem useful to build graphs by accumulating repetitive content within a loop, for example if we wanted to systematically make small changes to the content like varying a slope, intercept, or power in a polynomial. However, printing legends requires multiple pieces of information and adding information ‘one at a time’ is at odds with the construction of the legend. There are certainly workarounds to this, but the code quickly becomes quite lengthy. All of this extra code means it might have been faster to just type out the contents of the graph from the start , Those willing to put in some extra work, might experiment with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Tooltip[]</code> command and its ability to place text (i.e., labels of curves) at certain points on a graph.</p>
