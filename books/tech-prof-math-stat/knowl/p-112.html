We also experimented with how to change these points on a graph with multiple functions being plotted. We learned how to label and change the size of axes, as well as how to make a legend that includes the different line styles, bullets, and colors that we have used. We also were shown how to label the axis, as well as write text inside the graph at specific co-ordinates.</p>
