<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Though not all of us had proof-writing experience (that’s okay) we presented a proof of the claim that “the number \(n^2 - n\) is always even for integers \(n\text{.}\)” The method was proof by cases, or for some of you something better known as proof by exhaustion. There were quite a few observations regarding the structure of commands. In particular, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">beginalign...endalign</code> is coded to produce math displays of its contents. No additional mathematical delimiters <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(...)</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[...]</code> are required or desired. In general, we want to use these somewhat sparingly, that is write ‘\(n^2-n\)’ as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(n^2-n)</code>, rather than <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(n^2) - n</code>, in this second form, the spacing will be wrong and we lose the fact that the expression is a single object. We should also avoid putting blank lines inside <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">align</code> environments, remember our end of line characters <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore"></code>, and our carefully spaced alignment characters <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&amp;</code>.</p>
