<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In class today we learned how to make tables. There were some aspects of creating a table that I didn't even know how to make in a regular word document. I've always struggled to make tables in papers, especially with the spacing of the content. Learning how to make them in <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> showed me a lot easier way to make them and not have to spend hours on trying to get it perfect. Learning how to reference the tables so it will change if you move it positions was cool too. There have been many times where I've had to go through a whole paper and change every reference to match, and this will make it less of a hassle.</p>
