<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We started the first 15 minutes of class working on the prompt 1 homework assignment and asking questions about issues and problems that we were having. Next we started with a new blank document saved as day 4 so that we could add graphics and the tables from day 3. We copy pasted the tables that we had previously created and created a cross-reference by using a different label and then referencing the second table. <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> handles labeling efficiently and will automatically track where graphs are located. Then we added two different graphs on a new page. We ended the class with quickly re-sizing the graphs to fit on the page comfortably.</p>
