<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the first part of class, Dr. Laverty let us fix our homework if we forgot our Improvement Plan. The Improvement Plan goes after the end of the document in a comment section. It tells what you would like to improve on, what you wish you knew how to do, and changes you would like to make the next time. For example, I said I would like to improve my document’s aesthetic qualities with items like pictures and colored fonts. For the second part of class, we began learning about “Google Sheets". We started a new spreadsheet entitled “Health Info" and included nine student’s information about their birth year, and height in feet and inches. We then learned how to calculate the ages and height in meters of said students using the formulas \(``current\,year - birth\,year"\,and \,``height\,in\,feet
*(12*\frac{2.54}{100}) + height\,in\,inches*(\frac{2.54}{100})\text{,}\) respectively. We also calculated the information’s average, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum using Google Spreadsheets provided formulas. Using the height and age as our variables, we then made a scatter plot.</p>
