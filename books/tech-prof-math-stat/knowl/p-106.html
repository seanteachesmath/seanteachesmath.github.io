<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Then, we tried some functions ourselves, making up new functions and plotting them with tangent lines of different colors at our guesses. A common error we had in class was forgetting the asterisk every time we wanted to multiply something. For example, when typing \(3x\text{,}\) it needed to be “\(3*x\)”. After we played around with these a bit, as a class, we used a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loop to print tangent lines of all guesses from 1 to 10 (because our for loop went from 1 to 10), and showed 10 different tangent lines in 10 different colors. Using “col=j” shows 10 different colors because our j went from 1 to 10. Then we played around with our own functions from earlier in class, adding the for loop with multiple tangent lines, and could use smaller \(x\)-limits to see which of our guesses were the closest.</p>
