<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In many situations we might imagine solving an equation or system of equations, with the hope of using the value or values for subsequent calculations. For example, one might want to compute critical points of a function and use those points to evaluate the values of the function or its second derivative. Once we get these values, we have to consider how we might use them in subsequent work. We do not (or at least should not) necessarily want to copy and paste these into subsequent calculations, because should our original problem change for some reason (a typo, new information, a new but related situation) we would have to copy and paste again. Instead we want to attempt to automate the extraction and use of this newly found information.</p>
