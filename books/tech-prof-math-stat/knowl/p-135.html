<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Today was unlike any other day of the semester. Dr. Laverty referred to it as Hackathon DAGGER This is where a group of students get together, come up with a cool mathematical idea, and write a program that executes that idea. This was a great chance for us to write programs that we have always wanted to, using R or Sage. All the groups came up with really cool ideas. For instance, the members of my group and I decided to write a program using sage, that finds the area of a cardioid. Today we had a chance to use all the material that we have learned so far, to write interesting programs. Hackathon was a nice way to end the semester.</p>
