<title>Linear Functions</title>

<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>   
<p>As we saw in <xref ref="LinMod" text="type-global" />, many linear models <m>y = f (x)</m> have equations of the form
    <me>\blert{f(x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x}</me>
The starting value, or the value of <m>y</m> at <m>x = 0</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    <me>\blert{f (x) = b + mx}</me>
where the constant term, <m>b</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line, and <m>m</m>, the coefficient of <m>x</m>, is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the <term>slope-intercept form</term><idx>slope-intercept form</idx>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>If we write the equation of a linear function in the form,
        <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
    then <m>m</m> is the <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>(You may have encountered the slope-intercept equation in the equivalent form <m>y = mx + b</m>.)</p>
<p> For example, consider the two linear functions and their graphs shown below. </p>

<p>Some observations:<ul>
        <li>We can see that the <m>y</m>-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, <m>b</m>. </li>
        <li>By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of <m>x</m>gives the slope of the line:</li> 
    <li>For <m>f (x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> decreases by <m>3</m> units.</li>
    <li> For <m>g(x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> increases by <m>2</m> units.</li>
</ul>

     For each graph, the coefficient of <m>x</m> is a scale factor that tells us how many units <m>y</m> changes for <m>1</m> unit increase in <m>x</m>. But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.</p>

<solution><p>Francine pays the same initial amount, $30 for the modem, under each plan. The monthly fee is the rate of change of her total cost, in dollars per month. We can write a formula for her cost under each plan.

The graphs of these three functions all have the same <m>y</m>-intercept, but their slopes are determined by the monthly fees.

    In the equation <m>f (x) = b + mx</m>, we call <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> <term>parameters</term><idx>parameters</idx>. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation <m>y = 3+2x</m>, <m>b=3</m> and <m>m=2</m>, and the variables are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. By changing the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>, we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line. The collection of all linear functions <m>f(x) = b + mx</m> is called a <term>two-parameter</term><idx>two-parameter</idx> family of functions.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Method of Graphing</title>

<p>Look again at the lines in the previous figure: There is only one line that has a given slope and passes through a particular point. That is, the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> determine the particular line. The value of <m>b</m> gives us a starting point, and the value of <m>m</m> tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.</p>

<example xml:id="example-slope-intercept"><statement><p><ol label="a">
        <li>Write the equation <m>4x - 3y = 6</m> in slope-intercept form.</li>
        <li>Graph the line by hand.</li>
    </ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
        <li>We solve the equation for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
            <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                -3y \amp =6 - 4x \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by } -3}\\
                y \amp = \frac{6 - 4x}{-3}=\frac{6}{-3}+\frac{-4x}{-3}\\
                y \amp = -2+\frac{4}{3}x
            \end{aligned}</me><!--*****--></li>
        <li>We see that the slope of the line is <m>m = \dfrac{4}{3}</m> and its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>b = -2</m>. We begin by plotting the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0, -2)</m>. We then use the slope to find another point on the line. We have
        <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{4}{3}</me>
        so starting at <m>(0, -2)</m>, we move <m>4</m> units in the <m>y</m>-direction and <m>3</m> units in the <m>x</m>-direction, to arrive at the point <m>(3, 2)</m>. Finally, we draw the line through these two points. </li>

<note><p>The slope of a line is a ratio and can be written in many equivalent ways. In <xref ref="example-slope-intercept" text="type-global" />, the slope is equal to <m>\dfrac{8}{6}</m>, <m>\dfrac{12}{9}</m>, and <m>\dfrac{-4}{-3}</m>. We can use any of these fractions to locate a third
point on the line as a check. If we use <m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \dfrac{-4}{-3}</m>, we move down <m>4</m> units and left <m>3</m> units from the <m>y</m>-intercept to find the point <m>(-3, -6)</m> on the line.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Finding a Linear Equation from a Graph</title>
    <p>We can also use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of a line from its graph. First, we note the value of the <m>y</m>-intercept from the graph, and then we calculate the slope using two convenient points.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Point-Slope Form</title>

<p>We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and <m>y</m>-intercept. What if we do not know the <m>y</m>-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope, so we should be able to find its equation.</p>

<p>For example, we can graph the line of slope <m>\dfrac{-3}{4}</m> that passes through the point <m>(1, -4)</m>. 
We first plot the given point, <m>(1, -4)</m>, as shown in the figure below.</p>

    <sidebyside widths="60% 35%"><p> Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is
        <me>m =\frac{-3}{4}= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</me>
    so we move down <m>3</m> units and then <m>4</m> units to the right, starting from <m>(1, -4)</m>. This brings us to the point <m>(5, -7)</m>. We can then draw the line through these two points.</p>
    <image source="images/fig-point-slope"><description>point slope</description></image></sidebyside>

    <p>We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in <xref ref="example-point-slope" text="type-global" />.</p>

<example xml:id="example-point-slope"><statement>
    <p>Find an equation for the line that passes through <m>(1, -4)</m> and has slope <m>\dfrac{-3}{4}</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We will use the formula for slope,
    <me>m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</me>
    We substitute <m>\dfrac{-3}{4}</m> for the slope, <m>m</m>, and <m>(1, -4)</m> for <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>. For the second point, <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, we use the variable point <m>(x, y)</m>. Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us
    <me>\frac{-3}{4}= \frac{y - (-4)}{x - 1}=\frac{y + 4}{x - 1}</me>
    To solve for <m>y</m> we first multiply both sides by <m>x - 1</m>.
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \alert{(x-1)}\frac{-3}{4}\amp
                =\frac{y +4}{x - 1}\alert{(x-1)} \amp\amp\\
                \frac{-3}{4}(x-1)\amp=y+4  \amp\amp\blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}\\
                \frac{-3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}\amp=y+4   \amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}}\\
                \frac{-3}{4}x-\frac{13}{4}\amp=y \amp\amp \blert{\frac{3}{4}-4=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{16}{4}=\frac{-13}{4}}\\
    \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
    The equation of the line is  <m>y=\dfrac{-13}{4}-\dfrac{3}{4}x</m>
</p></solution></example>

<p>When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point <m>(x, y)</m> for the second point. This version of the formula, 
    <me>m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}</me>
is called the <term>point-slope form</term><idx>point-slope form</idx> for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \alert{(x-x_1)}m\amp
                =\frac{y -y_1}{x - x_1}\alert{(x-x_1)} \amp\amp
                \blert{\text{Multiply both sides by }(x - x_1)}\\
                (x - x_1) m\amp=y-y_1  \amp\amp\blert{\text{Clear fractions and solve for }y\text{.}}\\
