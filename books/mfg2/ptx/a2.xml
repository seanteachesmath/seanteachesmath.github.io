<p>An <term>equation</term> is just a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Equations relating two variables are particularly useful. If we know the value of one of the variables, we can find the corresponding value of the other variable by solving the equation.</p>

<example><statement><p>The equation <m>w = 6h</m> gives Loren's wages, <m>w</m>, in terms of the number of hours she works, <m>h</m>. How many hours does Loren need to work next week if she wants to earn $<m>225</m>?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We know that <m>w = 225</m>, and we would like to know the value of <m>h</m>. We substitute the value for <m>w</m> into our equation and then solve for <m>h</m>.
        <md>
            <mrow>w \amp= 6h\amp\amp \blert{\text{Substitute 225 for }w.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\alert{225} \amp= 6h\amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by } 6.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{225}{\alert{6}}\amp = \frac{6h}{\alert{6}}\amp\amp \blert{\text{Simplify.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>375.5\amp = h</mrow>
        </md>
Loren must work <m>37.5</m> hours in order to earn $<m>225</m>. In reality, Loren will probably have to work for <m>38</m> hours, because most employers do not pay for portions of an hour's work. Thus, Loren needs to work for <m>38</m> hours.</p>
</solution></example>

<p>To solve an equation we can generate simpler equations that have the same solutions. Equations that have identical solutions are called <term>equivalent equations</term><idx>equivalent equations</idx>. For example,
    <me>3x - 5 = x + 3</me>
and
    <me>2x = 8</me>
are equivalent equations because the solution of each equation is <m>4</m>. Often we can find simpler equivalent equations by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Solving Linear Equations</title>

<p><term>Linear</term>, or first-degree, equations can be written so that every term is either a constant or a constant times the variable. The equations above are examples of linear equations. Recall the following rules for solving linear equations.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Generate Equivalent Equations</title>
<p><ol label="1">
        <li><p>We can add or subtract the <em>same</em> number on <em>both</em> sides of an equation.</p></li>
        <li><p>We can multiply or divide <em>both</em> sides of an equation by the <em>same</em> number (except zero).</p></li>
    </ol></p></assemblage>

<p>Applying either of these rules produces a new equation equivalent to the old one and thus preserves the solution.</p>

<p>We use the rules to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~~3x - 5 = x + 3</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We first collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation, and the constant terms on the other side.
        <md><mrow>3x - 5 \alert{{}- x} \amp = x + 3 \alert{{}- x}\amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract }x \text{ from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x - 5 \amp = 3\amp\amp \blert{\text{Simplify.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x - 5 \alert{{}+ 5} \amp = 5 \alert{{}+ 5}\amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 5 to both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x \amp = 8 \amp\amp\blert{\text{Simplify.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{2x}{\alert{2}}\amp =\frac{8}{\alert{2}}\amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp = 4\amp\amp\blert{\text{Simplify.}}</mrow>
        </md>
The solution is <m>4</m>. (You can check the solution by substituting <m>4</m> into the original equation to show that a true statement results.)</p></solution></example>

<p>The following steps should enable you to solve any linear equation. Of course, you may not need all the steps for a particular equation.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Solve a Linear Equation:</title>
<p><ol label="1">
        <li><p>Simplify each side of the equation separately.
            <ol label="a">
                <li><p> Apply the distributive law to remove parentheses.</p></li>
                <li><p>Collect like terms.</p></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><p>By adding or subtracting appropriate terms on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.</p></li>
        <li><p>Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.</p></li>
    </ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~3(2x - 5) - 4x = 2x - (6 - 3x)</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We begin by simplifying each side of the equation.
        <md><mrow>3(2x - 5) - 4x \amp = 2x - (6 - 3x) \amp\amp\blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>6x - 15 - 4x \amp= 2x - 6 + 3x \amp\amp\blert{\text{Combine like terms on each side.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x - 15 \amp= 5x - 6</mrow>
        </md>
Next, we collect all the variable terms on the left side of the equation, and all the constant terms on the right side.
        <md><mrow>2x - 15 \alert{- 5x + 15} \amp= 5x - 6 \alert{- 5x + 15} \amp\amp\blert{\text{Add }-5x + 15 \text{ to both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>-3x \amp= 9</mrow>
        </md>
Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.
        <md><mrow> -3x \amp= 9 \amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by }-3.}</mrow>
            <mrow> x \amp =-3</mrow>
        </md>
The solution is <m>-3</m>.</p></solution></example>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Formulas</title>

<p>A <term>formula</term><idx>formula</idx> is an equation that relates several variables. For example, the equation 
    <me>P = 2l + 2w</me>
gives the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of its length and width.</p>

<p>Suppose we have some wire fence to enclose an exercise area for rabbits, and we would like to see what dimensions are possible for different rectangles with that perimeter. In this case, it would be more useful to have a formula for the length of the rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width. We can find such a formula by solving the perimeter formula for <m>l</m> in terms of <m>P</m> and <m>w</m>.
    <md><mrow>2l + 2w \amp= P \amp\amp\blert{\text{Subtact }2 w \text{ from both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>2l \amp= P - 2w \amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>l \amp= \frac{P - 2w}{2}</mrow>
    </md>
The result is a new formula that gives the length of a rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width.</p>

<example><statement><p>The formula <m>~5F = 9C + 160~</m> relates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, <m>F</m>, to the temperature in degrees Celsius, <m>C</m>. Solve the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We begin by isolating the term that contains <m>C</m>.
        <md><mrow>5F \amp= 9C + 160 \amp\amp\blert{\text{Subtract 160 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>5F - 160 \amp = 9C \amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by 9.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{5F - 160}{9} \amp =C</mrow>
        </md>
We can also write the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> as <m>~C = \dfrac{5}{9}F - \dfrac{160}{9}</m>.</p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~3x - 5y = 40~</m> for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We isolate <m>y</m> on one side of the equation.
        <md><mrow>3x - 5y \amp = 40\amp\amp\blert{\text{Subtract }3x \text{ from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>-5y \amp = 40 - 3x\amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by }-5.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{-5y}{-5} \amp = \frac{40 - 3x}{-5}\amp\amp\blert{\text{Simplify both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = -8 + \frac{3}{5}x</mrow>
        </md>
    </p></solution></example>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Linear Inequalities</title>

<p>The symbol <m>\blert{\gt}</m> is called an <term>inequality symbol</term><idx>inequality symbol</idx>, and the statement <m>a\gt b</m> is called an <term>inequality</term><idx>inequality</idx>. There are four inequality symbols:
    <md><mrow>\amp\gt \amp\amp\text{is greater than}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\lt \amp\amp\text{is less than}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\ge \amp\amp\text{is greater than or equal to}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\le \amp\amp\text{is less than or equal to}</mrow>
    </md></p>
<p>Inequalities that include the symbols <m>\gt</m> or <m>\le</m> are called <term>strict inequalities</term><idx>strict inequalities</idx>; those that include <m>\ge</m> or <m>\le</m> are called <term>nonstrict</term><idx>nonstrict</idx>.</p>

<p>If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, if we multiply both sides of the inequality
    <me>2\lt 5</me>
by <m>-3</m>, we get
    <md><mrow>\alert{-3}(2) \amp\gt \alert{-3}(5)\amp\amp \blert{\text{Change inequality symbol from }\lt \text{ to }\gt.}</mrow>
        <mrow>-6 \amp\gt -15</mrow>
    </md>
Because of this property, the rules for solving linear equations must be revised slightly for solving linear inequalities.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Solve a Linear Inequality:</title>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li><p>We may add or subtract the same number to both sides of an inequality without changing its solutions.</p></li>
    <li><p>We may multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>positive</em> number without changing its solutions.</p></li>
    <li><p>If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>negative</em> number, we must <em>reverse the direction of the inequality symbol</em>.</p></li>
    </ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Solve the inequality <m>~4 - 3x \ge -17</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>Use the rules above to isolate <m>x</m> on one side of the inequality.
        <md><mrow>4 - 3x \amp\ge -17\amp\amp\blert{\text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>-3x \amp\ge -21\amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by }-3.}</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp\le 7</mrow>
        </md>
Notice that we reversed the direction of the inequality when we divided by <m>-3</m>. Any number less than or equal to <m>7</m> is a solution of the inequality.</p></solution></example>

<p>A <term>compound inequality</term><idx>compound inequality</idx> involves two inequality symbols.</p>

<example xml:id="example-compound-inequality"><statement><p>Solve <m>~4 \le 3x + 10 \le 16</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We isolate <m>x</m> by performing the same operations on all three sides of the inequality.

        </md>
The solutions are all numbers between <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, inclusive.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Interval Notation</title>

<p>The solutions of the inequality in <xref ref="example-compound-inequality" text="type-global"/> form an interval. An <term>interval</term><idx>interval</idx> is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>

<p>The set <m>-2 \le x \le 2</m> includes its endpoints <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, so we call it a <term>closed interval</term><idx>closed interval</idx>, and we denote it by <m>[-2, 2]</m>. Its graph is shown in figure (a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval.  An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as <m>-2 \lt x \lt 2</m>, is called an <term>open interval</term><idx>open interval</idx>, and we denote it with round brackets, <m>(-2, 2)</m>. Its
graph is shown in figure (b).</p>

    <sidebyside><image source="images/fig-numline-closed-vs-open"><description>closed interval and open interva</description></image></sidebyside>

<warning><p>Do not confuse the open interval <m>(-2, 2)</m> with the point <m>(-2, 2)</m>! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.</p></warning>

<p>We can also discuss <term>infinite intervals</term><idx>infinite intervals</idx>, such as <m>~x\lt 3~</m> and <m>~x\ge -1~</m>, shown in the figure below. We denote the interval <m>~x\lt 3~</m> by <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>, and the interval <m>~x\ge -1~</m> by <m>[-1, \infty)</m>. The symbol <m>\infty</m>, for infinity, does not represent a specific real number; it indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line.</p> 
<sidebyside  width="70%"><image source="images/fig-numline-infinite-intervals"><description>infinite intervals</description></image> </sidebyside>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x\gt 2</m>, shown below, is the <term>union</term><idx>union</idx> of two intervals and is denoted by <m>(-\infty,-2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.</p>
<sidebyside  width="70%"><image source="images/fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals"><description>number line with two disjoint infinite intervals</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.</p>

<example><statement><p>Write each of the solution sets with interval notation and graph the solution set on a number line.
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p><m>3 \le x \lt 6</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>x \ge -9</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>x\le 1 ~~\text{ or }~~ x\gt 4</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>-8 \lt x \le -5 ~~\text{ or }~~ -1 \le x \lt 3</m></p></li>
        </ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p><m>[3, 6)</m>. This is called a <term>half-open</term><idx>half-open</idx> or <term>half-closed</term><idx>half-closed</idx> interval. </p>

    <li><p><m>[-9,\infty)</m>. We always use round brackets next to the symbol <m>\infty</m> because <m>\infty</m> is not a specific number and is not included in the set. </p>

    <li><p><m>(-\infty, 1] \cup (4, \infty)</m>. The word <em>or</em> describes the union of two sets. </p>
