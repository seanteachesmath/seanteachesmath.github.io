<title>Factors and <m>x</m>-Intercepts</title>

<introduction><p>In <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, perhaps you recognized the graph of the baseball's height as a parabola. In this chapter, we shall see that the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola.</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-quadratic-function.xml" />

<note><p>In the definition above, notice that if <m>a</m> is zero, there is no <m>x</m>-squared term, so the function is not quadratic.</p></note>

<p>In <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, the height of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit was given by
	<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
We used a graph to find two times when the baseball was <m>64</m> feet high. Can we solve the same problem algebraically?</p>

<p>We are looking for values of <m>t</m> that produce <m>h = 64</m> in the height equation. So, if we substitute <m>h = 64</m> into the height equation, we would like to solve the <term>quadratic equation</term>
	<me>64 = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable <m>t</m>, and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>

<p>Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. This property of numbers is called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-zero-factor-principle.xml" />

<p>The principle is true even if the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are represented by algebraic expressions, such as <m>x - 5</m> or <m>2x + 1</m>. For example, if
	<me>(x - 5)(2x + 1) = 0</me>
then it must be true that either <m>x - 5 = 0</m> or <m>2x + 1 = 0</m>. Thus, we can use the zero-factor principle to solve equations.</p>

<example xml:id="example-ZFP"><statement><p><ol label="a">
	<li>Solve the equation <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = 0</m>.</li>

	</ol></p></statement>

	There are two solutions, <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>. (You should check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.)</p></li>
	<li><p>To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph, we set <m>y = 0</m> and solve the equation

	But this is the equation we solved in part (a), because <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4x - 12</m>.
	The solutions of that equation were <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>, so the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>. You can see this by graphing the equation on your calculator, as shown below.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</title>

<p>Before we apply the zero-factor principle to solve a quadratic equation, we must first write the equation so that one side of the equation is zero. Let us introduce some terminology.</p>

<assemblage><title>Forms for Quadratic Equations</title>
<p><ol>
	<li>A quadratic equation written
			 <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>
	 is in <term>standard form</term><idx>standard form</idx>.</li>
	<li>A quadratic equation written 
			<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
	is in <term>factored form</term><idx>factored form</idx>.</li>
	</ol></p></assemblage>

<p>Once we have written the equation in standard form, we factor the left side and set each variable factor equal to zero separately.</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-via-factoring"><statement><p>Solve <m>~~3x(x + 1) = 2x + 2</m></p></statement>
<solution><p>First, we write the equation in standard form.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		3x(x + 1) \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law to the left side.}}\\
		3x^2 + 3x \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract }2x + 2 \text{ from both sides.}}\\
		3x^2 + x - 2 \amp = 0
		\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
	Next, we factor the left side to obtain
		<me>(3x - 2)(x + 1) = 0</me>
	We then apply the zero-factor principle by setting each factor equal to zero.
		<me>3x - 2 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ x + 1 = 0</me>
		Finally, we solve each equation to find
		<me>x = \frac{2}{3} ~~\text{ or }~~ x = -1</me>
	The solutions are <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> and <m>-1</m>.</p></solution></example>

<warning><title></title><p>When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation <em>must be zero</em>. For example, to solve the equation
	<me>(x - 2)(x - 4) = 15</me>
it is incorrect to set each factor equal to <m>15</m>! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal <m>15</m>; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be <m>15</m>.) We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>; make sure you can find these solutions.)</p></warning>

<p>We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-solve-quadratic-by-factoring.xml" />

<exercise><statement><p>Solve by factoring: <m>~~(t - 3)^2 = 3(9 - t)</m></p>

<p>We can use factoring to solve the equation from <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-height-of-baseball"><statement><p>The height, <m>h</m>, of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit is given by

<solution><p>We substitute <m>64</m> for <m>h</m> in the formula, and solve for <m>t</m>.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]

		\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
There are two solutions to the quadratic equation. At <m>t = \dfrac{3}{2}</m> seconds, the ball reaches a height of <m>64</m> feet on the way up, and at <m>t = \dfrac{5}{2}</m> seconds, the ball is <m>64</m> feet high on its way down. </p>

<p>In the solution to <xref ref="example-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, the factor <m>4</m> does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. First, check that the two equations
	<me>x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ~~\text{ and }~~ 4(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0</me>
have the same solutions, <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>. Then use your graphing calculator to graph the equation
	<me>Y_1 = X^2 - 4X + 3</me>
in the window
	    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
        \text{Xmin} \amp = -2 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 8\\
        \text{Ymin} \amp = -5 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
        \end{aligned}</me>
Notice that when <m>y = 0</m>, <m>x = 3</m> or <m>x = 1</m>. These two points are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph. In the same window, now graph
       <me>Y_2 = 4(X^2 - 4X + 3)</me>
This graph has the same <m>x</m>-values when <m>y = 0</m>. The factor of <m>4</m> stretches the graph vertically but does not change the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p>

<p> The value of the constant factor <m>a</m> in the factored form of a quadratic function, <m>f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)</m>, does not affect the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts, because it does not affect the solutions of the equation <m>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</m>.</p>

<subsection><title>Applications</title>

<p>Here is another example of how quadratic equations arise in applications.</p>

<example xml:id="example-computer-screen"><statement>
	<sidebyside widths="20% 60%" valigns="middle middle">
	<image source="images/fig-computer-screen"><description>computer screen</description></image>
<p>The size of a rectangular computer monitor screen is given by the length of its diagonal, as shown at left. If the length of the screen should be <m>3</m> inches greater than its width, what are the dimensions of a <m>15</m>-inch monitor? </p></sidebyside></statement>

<solution><p>We express the two dimensions of the screen in terms of a single variable:</p>
		<sidebyside><tabular>
			<row><cell>Width of screen: <m>~~ w</m></cell></row>
			<row><cell>Length of screen: <m>~~ w + 3</m></cell></row>
		</tabular></sidebyside>
<p>We can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation.
		<me>w^2 + (w + 3)^2 = 15^2</me>
Solve the equation. Begin by simplifying the left side.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		w^2 + w^2 + 6w + 9 \amp = 225\amp\amp \blert{\text{Write the equation in standard form.}}\\
		2w^2 + 6w - 216 \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Factor 2 from the left side.}}\\
		2(w^2 + 3w - 108) \amp = 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Factor the quadratic expression.}}\\
		2(w - 9)(w + 12) \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Set each variable factor equal to zero.}}\\
		w - 9 =0~~ \text{ or }~~ w + 12 \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Solve each equation.}}\\
		w =9{} ~~~\text{ or } ~~~{}w \amp= -12
		\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Because the width of the screen cannot be a negative number, we discard the solution <m>w = -12</m>. Thus, the width is <m>w = 9</m> inches, and the length is <m>w + 3 = 12</m> inches.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Solutions of Quadratic Equations</title>

<p>We have seen that the solutions of the quadratic equation
	<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
are <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>. Thus, if we know the two solutions of a quadratic equation, we can work backward and reconstruct the equation, starting from its factored form. We can then write the equation in standard form by multiplying together the factors.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-equation-from-solutions"><statement><p>Find a quadratic equation whose solutions are <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>-3</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>The quadratic equation is 
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left[x-(-3)\right] \amp= 0\\
		\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)(x + 3) \amp = 0
		\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
To write the equation in standard form, we multiply the factors together.
		<me>x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}= 0</me>
We can also find an equation with integer coefficients if we clear the equation of fractions. Multiply both sides by <m>2</m>:
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		2\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}\right)\amp= 2(0)\\
		2x^2 + 5x - 3 \amp = 0
		\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
You can check that the solutions of this last equation are in fact <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>-3</m>. Multiplying both sides of an equation by a constant factor does not change its solutions.</p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement><p>Find a quadratic equation with integer coefficients whose solutions are <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> and <m>-5</m>.</p></statement>
<answer><p><m>3x^2 + 13x - 10 = 0</m></p></answer></exercise>

<note><p>A quadratic equation in one variable always has two solutions. However, in some cases, the solutions may be equal. For example, the equation
	<m>x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0</m>
can be solved by factoring as follows:
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	(x - 1)(x - 1) \amp = 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the zero-factor principle.}}\\
	x - 1 =0 ~~\text{ or } ~~ x - 1 \amp= 0
	\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Both of these equations have solution <m>1</m>. We say that <m>1</m> is a solution of <term>multiplicity</term><idx>multiplicity</idx> two, meaning that it occurs twice as a solution of the quadratic equation.</p></note>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Equations Quadratic in Form</title>

<p>The equation <me>x^6 - 4x^3 - 5 = 0</me> is not quadratic, but if we make the substitution <m>u = x^3</m>, the equation becomes <me>u^2 - 4u - 5 = 0</me> An equation is called <term>quadratic in form</term><idx>quadratic in form</idx> if we can use a substitution to write it as <me>au^2 + bu + c = 0</me> where <m>u</m> stands for an algebraic expression. Such equations can be solved by the same techniques we use to solve quadratic equations.</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-in-form"><statement><p>Use the substitution <m>u = x^3</m> to solve the equation <me>x^6 - 4x^3 - 5 = 0</me></p></statement>
<solution><p>We set <m>u = x^3</m>, so that <m>u^2 = \left(x^3\right)^2 = x^6</m>. The original equation then becomes a quadratic equation in the variable <m>u</m>, which we can solve by factoring.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]

Finally, we replace <m>u</m> by <m>x^3</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]

You can verify that the solutions of the original equation are <m>-1</m> and <m>\sqrt[3]{5}</m>.</p></solution></example>

<p>We say that the equation in <xref ref="example-quadratic-in-form" text="type-global"/>, <m>x^6 - 4x^3 - 5 = 0</m>, is <term>quadratic in</term><idx>quadratic in</idx> <m>x^3</m>. We chose the substitution <m>u = x^3</m> because <m>x^6 = u^2</m>.</p>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-quadratic-in-form"><statement><p>Use the substitution <m>u = x^2</m> to solve the equation <m>x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0</m>.</p></statement>
<answer><p><m>x=\pm\sqrt{2} </m>, <m>~x=\pm\sqrt{3} </m></p></answer></exercise>

<p>Usually, you can choose the simpler variable term in the equation for the <m>u</m>-substitution. For example, in  <xref ref="exercise-quadratic-in-form" text="type-global"/> we chose <m>u = x^2</m> because <m>u^2 = \left(x^2\right)^2 = x^4</m>, which is the first term of the equation. Once you have chosen the <m>u</m>-substitution, you should check that the other variable term is then a multiple of <m>u^2</m>; otherwise, the equation is not quadratic in form.</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-in-form2"><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>e^{2x} - 7e^x + 12 = 0</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We use the substitution <m>u = e^x</m>, because <m>u^2 = \left(e^x\right)^2 = e^{2x}</m>. The original equation then becomes

		(u - 3)(u - 4) \amp = 0 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the zero-factor principle.}}\\

		u \amp =3 ~~\text{ or } ~~ u = 4

Finally, we replace <m>u</m> by <m>e^x</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]

You should verify that the solutions of the original equation are <m>\ln (3)</m> and <m>\ln (4)</m>.</p></solution></example>
