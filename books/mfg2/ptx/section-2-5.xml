<title>The Absolute Value Function</title>
<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

<p>The absolute value function is used to model problems involving distance. Recall that the absolute value of a number gives the distance from the origin to that number on the number line.</p>

<assemblage><title>Distance and Absolute Value</title>
<p>The distance between two points <m>x</m> and <m>a</m> is given by <m>\abs{x - a}</m>.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>For example, the equation <m>\abs{x - 2} = 6</m> means "the distance between <m>x</m> and <m>2</m> is <m>6</m> units." The number <m>x</m> could be to the left or the right of <m>2</m> on the number line. Thus, the equation has two solutions, <m>8</m> and <m>-4</m>, as shown below.</p>

<subsection><title>Absolute Value Equations</title>

<p>We can use distances on a number line to solve simple equations such as
    <me>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</me>
 First, we factor out the coefficient of <m>x</m>, to get <m>\abs{3(x - 2)} = 9</m>. Because of the multiplicative property of the absolute value, namely that 
    <m>\abs{ab} = \abs{a}\abs{b}</m>, we can write the left side as 
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    \abs{3}\abs{x - 2} \amp = 9 \\
    3\abs{x - 2} \amp= 9 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 3.}}\\
     \abs{x - 2} \amp = 3 
     \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
which tells us that the distance between <m>x</m> and <m>2</m> is <m>3</m> units, so the solutions are <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 5</m>. </p>

<sidebyside widths= "55% 35%" valigns="middle middle" margins="0% 5%">
<stack><p>Alternatively, we can use graphs when working with absolute values. For example, we know that the simple equation <m>\abs{x} = 5</m> has two solutions, <m>x = 5</m> and <m>x = -5</m>.</p><p> In fact, we can see from the graph at right that the equation <m>\abs{x} = k</m> has two solutions if <m>k \gt 0</m>, one solution if <m>k = 0</m>, and no solution if <m>k \lt 0</m>.</p></stack>

<p>To solve an absolute value equation algebraically, we use the definition of absolute value.</p>

<example xml:id="example-abs-algebraic"><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</m> algebraically.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We write the piecewise definition of <m>\abs{3x - 6}</m>.
    <me>
    \abs{3x-6} =
    \begin{cases}
    3x-6 \amp \text{if } 3x-6\ge 0 \text{, or  } x\ge 2\\
    -(3x-6)  \amp \text{if } 3x - 6\lt 0  \text{, or  }x\lt 2
    \end{cases}
    </me>
Thus, the absolute value equation <m>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</m> is equivalent to two regular equations:
    <me>3x - 6 =9~~~  \text{ or }~~~ -(3x - 6) = 9</me>
or, by simplifying the second equation,
    <me>3x - 6 =9~~~ \text{ or }~~~ 3x - 6 = -9</me>
Solving these two equations gives us the same solutions we found in <xref ref="example-abs-equation" text="type-global"/>, namely <m>x = 5</m> and <m>-1</m>.</p></solution></example>

<p>In general, we have the following strategy for solving absolute value equations.</p>

<assemblage><title>Absolute Value Equations</title><p></p>
<p>The equation
    <me>\abs{ax + b} = c \hphantom{break} (c \gt 0)</me>

    <me>ax + b = c ~~\text{ or }~~ ax + b = -c</me></p>

<answer><p><m>x=-9</m> or <m>x=2</m></p></answer></exercise>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Absolute Value Inequalities</title>

<p>We can also use graphs to solve absolute value inequalities. Look again at the graph of <m>y = \abs{3x - 6}</m> in figure (a) below. </p>

    <sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/fig-abs-inequality"><description>abs-3x-6</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>Because of the V-shape of the graph, all points with <m>y</m>-values less than <m>9</m> lie between the two solutions of <m>~\abs{3x - 6} = 9~</m>, that is, between <m>-1</m> and <m>5</m>. Thus, the solutions of the inequality <m>~\abs{3x - 6} \lt 9~</m> are <m>-1 \lt x \lt 5</m>. (In the Homework Problems, you will be asked to show this algebraically.) </p>

<p>On the other hand, to solve the inequality <m>~\abs{3x - 6} \gt 9~</m>, we look for points on the graph with <m>y</m>-values greater than <m>9</m>. In figure (b), we see that these points have <m>x</m>-values outside the interval between <m>-1</m> and <m>5</m>. In other words, the solutions of the inequality <m>~\abs{3x - 6} \gt 9~</m> are <m>x \lt -1</m> or <m>x \gt 5</m>.</p>

<p>Thus, we can solve an absolute value inequality by first solving the related equation.</p>

<assemblage><title>Absolute Value Inequalities</title>
<p>Suppose the solutions of the equation <m>\abs{ax+b}=c</m> are <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, with <m>r \lt s</m>. Then
    <ol>
        <li>The solutions of <m>~\abs{ax+b} \lt c~</m> are 
        <me>r \lt  x \lt  s</me></li>
        <li>The solutions of <m>~\abs{ax+b} \gt c~</m> are
        <me>x \lt  r ~~\text{ or }~~ x \gt  s</me></li>
    </ol></p></assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-abs-inequality"><statement><p>Solve <m>~\abs{4x - 15} \lt 0.01</m></p></statement>
<solution><p>First, we solve the equation <m>~\abs{4x - 15} = 0.01</m>. There are two cases:
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}[t]
        4x - 15 \amp = 0.01 \amp \text{or} \amp\amp 4x - 15 \amp= -0.01 \\
        4x \amp = 15.01 \amp\amp\amp 4x \amp = 14.99 \\
        x \amp = 3.7525 \amp\amp\amp x \amp= 3.7475
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
Because the inequality symbol is <m>\lt</m>, the solutions of the inequality are between these two values: <m>3.7475 \lt x \lt 3.7525</m>. In interval notation, the solutions are <m>(3.7475, 3.7525)</m>.</p> </solution></example>

Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17. </p>

    <li><p>We plot the points in the table to obtain the graph shown below. This graph looks like the absolute value function defined in <xref ref="basic-functions" text="type-global"/>, except that the vertex is the point <m>(15, 0)</m> instead of the origin.</p>
        <sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-abs-highway-distance"><description>graph of distance from mall</description></image></sidebyside></li>
    <li><p>Let <m>x</m> represent the number of miles on the highway and <m>f (x)</m> the number of miles from the mall. For <m>x</m>-values less than <m>15</m>, the graph is a straight line with slope <m>-1</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0, 15)</m>, so its equation is <m>y = -x + 15</m>. Thus,
        <me>f (x) = -x + 15~~~ \text{ when } ~~~0 \le x \lt 15</me>
    On the other hand, when <m>x \ge 15</m>, the graph of <m>f</m> is a straight line with slope <m>1</m> that passes through the point <m>(15, 0)</m>. The point-slope form of this line is
        <me>y = 0 + 1(x - 15)</me>
    so <m>y = x - 15</m>. Thus,
        <me>f (x) = x - 15~~~ \text{ when }~~~  x \ge 15</me>
    Combining the two pieces, we obtain
        <me>
        f (x) =
        \begin{cases}
        -x + 15~~~ \amp \text{when }~~~ 0\le x\lt 15\\
        x - 15~~~  \amp \text{when }~~~ x\ge 15
        \end{cases}
        </me>
    The graph of <m>f (x)</m> is a part of the graph of <m>y = \abs{x - 15}</m>. If we think of the highway as a portion of the real number line, with Marlene’s on-ramp located at the origin, then the outlet mall is located at <m>15</m>. Marlene's coordinate as she drives along the highway is <m>x</m>, and the distance from Marlene to the mall is given by <m>f (x) = \abs{x - 15}</m>.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Measurement Error</title>

<p>If you weigh a sample in chemistry lab, the scale’s digital readout might show <m>6.0</m> grams. But it is unlikely that the sample weighs <em>exactly</em> <m>6</m> grams; there is always some error in measured values.</p>
<p> Because the scale shows the weight as <m>6.0</m> grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between <m>5.95</m> grams and <m>6.05</m> grams: If the weight were less than <m>5.95</m> grams, the scale would round down to <m>5.9</m> grams, and if the weight were more than <m>6.05</m> grams, the scale would round up to <m>6.1</m> grams. We should report the mass of the sample as <m>6 \pm 0.05</m> grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than <m>0.05</m> grams. </p>

<p>We can also describe this measurement error, or <term>error tolerance</term><idx>error tolerance</idx>, using an absolute value inequality. Because the measured mass m can be no more than <m>0.05</m> from <m>6</m>, we write 
    <me>\abs{m - 6} \le 0.05</me> 
Note that the solution of this inequality is <m>5.95 \le m \le 6.05</m>.</p>   

<example xml:id="example-tolerance-chip-and-dosage"><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li>The specifications for a computer chip state that its thickness in millimeters must satisfy <m>\abs{t - 0.023} \lt 0.001</m>. What are the acceptable values for the thickness of the chip?</li>
    <li>The safe dosage of a new drug is between <m>250</m> and <m>450</m> milligrams, inclusive. Write the safe dosage as an error tolerance involving absolute values.</li>
</ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
        <li><p>The error tolerance can also be stated as <m>t = 0.023 \pm 0.001</m> millimeters, so the acceptable values are between <m>0.022</m> and <m>0.024</m> millimeters.</p></li>
        <li><p>The safe dosage <m>d</m> satisfies <m>250 \le d \le 450</m>, as shown below.</p>
        <sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/fig-dosage-tolerance"><description>safe dosage</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>The center of this interval is <m>350</m>, and the endpoints are each <m>100</m> units from the center. Thus, the safe values are within <m>100</m> units of <m>350</m>, or
        <me>\abs{d - 350} \le 100</me></p></li>
    </ol></p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement><p>The temperature, <m>T</m>, in a laboratory must remain between <m>9\degree\text{C}</m> and <m>12\degree\text{C}</m>.<ol label="a">
        <li>Write the error tolerance as an absolute value inequality.</li>
        <li>For a special experiment, the temperature in degrees celsius must satisfy <m>~~\abs{T - 6.7} \le 0.03</m>. Give the interval of possible temperatures.</li>
    </ol></p></statement>
<answer><p><ol label="a" cols="2">
    <li><p><m>\abs{T-10.5} \lt 1.5</m></p></li>
