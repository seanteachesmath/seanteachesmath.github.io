<p>Graphs are useful tools for studying mathematical relationships. A graph provides an overview of a quantity of data, and it helps us identify trends or unexpected occurrences. Interpreting the graph can help us answer questions about the data.</p>

<p>For example, here are some data showing the atmospheric pressure at different altitudes. Altitude is given in feet, and atmospheric pressure is given in inches of mercury.</p>

<p>We observe a generally decreasing trend in pressure as the altitude increases, but it is difficult to say anything more precise about this relationship. A clearer picture emerges if we plot the data. To do this, we use two perpendicular number lines called axes. We use the horizontal axis for the values of the first variable, altitude, and the vertical axis for the values of the second variable, pressure.</p>

<p>The entries in the table are called <term>ordered pairs</term>, in which the <term>first component</term> is the altitude and the <term>second component</term> is the atmospheric pressure measured at that altitude. For example, the first two entries can be represented by <m>(0, 29.7)</m> and <m>(5000, 24.8)</m>. We plot the points whose <term>coordinates</term> are given by the ordered pairs, as shown in the figure on the left.</p>

<p>We can connect the data points with a smooth curve as shown in the figure on the right. In doing this, we are assuming that one variable changes smoothly with respect to the other, and in fact this is true for many physical situations. Thus, a smooth curve will thus serve as a good model.

<subsection><title>Reading a Graph</title>

<p>Once we have constructed a graph, we can use it to estimate values of the variables between the known data points.</p>

<example xml:id="example-pressure-vs-altitude"><statement><p>From the graph of atmospheric pressure, estimate the following: <ol label="a">
            <li><p>
                The atmospheric pressure measured at an altitude of <m>15,000</m> feet </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The altitude at which the pressure is <m>12</m> inches of mercury</p></li>
        </ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><sidebyside  widths="45% 45%" valigns="middle middle" margins="0% 5%"><p>The point with first coordinate <m>15,000</m> on the graph at right has second coordinate approximately <m>17.4</m>. We estimate the pressure at <m>15,000</m> feet to be <m>17.4</m> inches of mercury.</p>
            <image source="images/fig-pressure-vs-altitude2"><description>graph of pressure vs altitude with two points highlighted</description></image> </sidebyside></li>
        <li><p>The point on the graph with second coordinate <m>12</m> has first coordinate approximately <m>25,000</m>, so an atmospheric pressure of <m>12</m> inches of mercury occurs at about <m>25,000</m> feet.</p></li>
    </ol></p></solution></example>

<p>We can also use the graph to obtain information about the relationship between altitude and pressure that would be difficult to see from the data alone.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>For what altitudes is the pressure less than <m>18</m> inches of mercury?</p></li>
    <li><p>How much does the pressure decrease as the altitude increases from <m>15,000</m> feet to <m>25,000</m> feet?</p></li>
    <li><p>For which <m>10,000</m>-foot increase in altitude does the pressure change most rapidly?</p></li>
</ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>From the graph we see that the pressure has dropped to <m>18</m> inches of mercury at about <m>14,000</m> feet, and that it continues to decrease as the altitude increases. Therefore, the pressure is less than <m>18</m> inches of mercury for altitudes greater than <m>14,000</m> feet.</p></li>
    <li><p>The pressure at <m>15,000</m> feet is approximately <m>17.4</m> inches of mercury, and at <m>25,000</m> feet it is <m>12</m> inches. This represents a decrease in pressure of <m>17.4 - 12</m>, or <m>5.4</m>, inches of mercury.</p></li>
    <li><p>By studying the graph we see that the pressure decreases most rapidly at low altitudes, so we conclude that the greatest drop in pressure occurs between <m>0</m> and <m>10,000</m> feet.</p></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Graphs of Equations</title>

<p>In <xref ref="example-pressure-vs-altitude" text="type-global"/>, we used a graph to illustrate data given in a table. Graphs can also help us analyze models given by equations. Let's first review some facts about solutions of equations in two variables.
</p>
<p>An equation in two variables, such as y = 2x + 3, is said to be satisfied if the variables are replaced by a pair of numbers that make the statement true. The pair of numbers is called a <term>solution</term><idx>solution</idx> of the equation and is usually written as an ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m>. (The first number in the pair is the value of <m>x</m> and the second number is the value of <m>y</m>.)</p>

<p>To find a solution of a given equation, we can assign a number to one of the variables and then solve for the second variable.
</p>

<example><statement><p>Find solutions to the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We choose some values for <m>x</m>, say, <m>-2</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>1</m>. Substitute these <m>x</m>-values into the equation to find a corresponding <m>y</m>-value for each.
        <md><mrow>\amp\text{When }x=-2,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{-2}) + 3 =-1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\text{When }x=0,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{0}) + 3 =3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\text{When }x=1,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{1}) + 3 =5</mrow>
        </md>
Thus, the ordered pairs <m>(-2, -1)</m>, <m>(0, 3)</m>, and <m>(1, 5)</m> are three solutions of <m>y = 2x + 3</m>. We can also substitute values for <m>y</m>. For example, if we let <m>y = \alert{10}</m>, we have
        <me>\alert{10} = 2x + 3</me>
Solving this equation for <m>x</m>, we find <m>7 = 2x</m>, or <m>x = 3.5</m>. This means that the ordered pair <m>(3.5, 10)</m> is another solution of the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.</p></solution></example>

<p>An equation in two variables may have infinitely many solutions, so we cannot list them all. However, we can display the solutions on a graph. For this we use a <term>Cartesian</term><idx>Cartesian</idx> (or <term>rectangular</term><idx>rectangular</idx>) <term>coordinate system</term><idx>coordinate system</idx>, as shown below left.</p>
<sidebyside  widths="40% 35%" margins="auto">
    <image source="images/fig-coordinate-plane"><description>coordinate plane</description></image>
    <image source="images/fig-line"><description>line in the coordinate plane</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>The <term>graph of an equation</term><idx>graph of an equation</idx> is a picture of its solutions. A point is included in the graph if its coordinates satisfy the equation, and if the coordinates do not satisfy the equation, the point is not part of the graph. A graph of <m>y = 2x + 3</m> is shown above right.</p>

<p>This graph does not display <em>all</em> the solutions of the equation, but it shows important features such as the intercepts on the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes. Because there is a solution corresponding to every real number <m>x</m>, the graph extends infinitely in either direction, as indicated by the arrows.</p>

<example><statement><sidebyside widths="50% 30%"><p> Use the graph of <m>y = 0.5x^2 - 2</m> shown at right to decide whether the given ordered pairs are solutions of the equation. Verify your answers algebraically.
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p><m>(-4, 6)</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>(3, 0)</m></p></li>
        </ol></p>
        <image source="images/fig-parabola0"  width="35%"><description>parabola in the coordinate plane</description></image> 
    </sidebyside></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
        <li><p>Because the point <m>(-4, 6)</m> does lie on the graph, the ordered pair <m>x=-4, y = 6</m> is a solution of <m>y = 0.5x^2 - 2</m>. We can verify this by substituting <m>\alert{-4}</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>\blert{6}</m> for <m>y</m>:
                <md><mrow>0.5(\alert{-4})^2 - 2 \amp= 0.5(16) - 2</mrow>
                    <mrow>= 8 - 2 \amp = \blert{6}</mrow></md></p></li>
        <li><p>Because the point <m>(3, 0)</m> does not lie on the graph, the ordered pair <m>x = 3, y = 0</m> is not a solution of <m>y = 0.5x^2 - 2</m>. We substitute <m>\alert{3}</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>\blert{0}</m> for <m>y</m> to verify this.
                <md><mrow>0.5(\alert{3})^2 - 2 \amp= 0.5(9) - 2</mrow>
                    <mrow>= 4.5 - 2 \amp = 2.5 \ne \blert{0}</mrow></md></p></li>
