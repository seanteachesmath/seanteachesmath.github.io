<title>Section Summary</title>

<subsubsection><title>CONCEPTS</title>
<p><ol label="1">
	<li>Systems involving conics may have up to four solutions.</li>
	<li>To solve some quadratic systems, we can use a combination of elimination of variables and substitution.</li></ol></p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection><title>STUDY QUESTIONS</title><p>
<ol label="1">
	<li>Name two algebraic techniques that are useful in solving systems of quadratic equations.</li>
	<li>In Example 1, why did we substitute the values of <m>x</m> into the second equation, rather than the first equation?</li>
	<li>How many solutions can a system of two ellipses have?  Illustrate your answer with sketches.</li>
	<li>Can two parabolas intersect in four points?  Illustrate with a sketch.</li></ol></p>
