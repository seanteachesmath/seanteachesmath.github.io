<p><ol label="1">
		<li>A function whose inputs are a set of successive positive integers is called a <term>sequence</term>.</li>
		<li>The output values are called the <term>terms</term> of the sequence.</li>
		<li>A formula in terms of <m>n</m> for the <m>n^{th}</m> term of a sequence is called the <term>general term</term> of the sequence.</li>
		<li>A sequence is defined <term>recursively</term> if each term of the sequence is defined in terms of its predecessors.</li></ol></p>
