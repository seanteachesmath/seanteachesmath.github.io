<p>How far can you throw a baseball? The distance depends on the initial speed of the ball, \(v\text{,}\) and on the angle at which you throw it. For maximum range, you should throw the ball at \(45\degree\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>If there were no air resistance, the height, \(x\text{,}\) of the ball t seconds after its release would be given in meters by the function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h=f(t)=\frac{vt}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{gt^2}{2} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Find an expression for the total time the ball is in the air. (<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Set \(h=0\) and solve for \(t\) in terms of the other variables.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At time \(t\text{,}\) the ball has traveled a horizontal distance \(d\) given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d=\frac{vt}{\sqrt{2}} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Find an expression for the range of the ball in terms of its velocity, \(v\text{.}\) (<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: In part (a), you found an expression for \(t\) when \(h = 0\text{.}\) Use that value of \(t\) to calculate \(d\) when \(h=0\text{.}\))</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fastest baseball pitch on record was \(45\) meters per second, or about \(100\) miles per hour. Use your formula from part (b) to calculate the theoretical range of such a pitch. The value of \(g\) is \(9.8\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum distance a baseball has actually been thrown is \(136\) meters. Can you explain the discrepancy between this figure and your answer to part (c)?</p></li>
