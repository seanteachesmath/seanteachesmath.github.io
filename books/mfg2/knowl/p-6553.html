<li><p>The graph of \(f(x) = 2^x + 3\text{,}\) shown in figure (b), has the same basic shape as that of \(h(x) = 2^x\text{,}\) but it has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = 3\) instead of at \(y = 0\) (the \(x\)-axis). In fact, \(f(x) = h(x) + 3\text{,}\) so the graph of \(f\) is a vertical translation of the graph of \(h\) by \(3\) units. If every point on the graph of \(h(x) = 2^x\) is moved \(3\) units upward, the result is the graph of \(f (x) = 2^x + 3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>First note that \(g(x) = 2^x+3 = h(x + 3)\text{.}\) In fact, the graph of \(g(x) = 2^{x+3}\) shown in figure (c) has the same basic shape as \(h(x) = 2^x\) but has been translated \(3\) units to the left.</p></li>
