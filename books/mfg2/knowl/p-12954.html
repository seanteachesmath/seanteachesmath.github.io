<p>Many endangered species have fewer than \(1000\) individuals left. To preserve the species, captive breeding programs must maintain a certain effective population, \(N\text{,}\) given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
N=\frac{4FM}{F+M} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(F\) is the number of breeding females and \(M\) the number of breeding males. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is the effective population if there are equal numbers of breeding males and females?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1972, a breeding program for Speke's gazelle was established with just three female gazelle. Graph the effective population, \(N\text{,}\) as a function of the number of males.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the largest effective population that can be created with three females? How many males are needed to achieve the maximum value?</p></li>
<li><p>With three females, for what value of \(M\) is \(N = M\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The breeding program for Speke's gazelle began with only one male. What was the effective population?</p></li>
