<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>The number of earthquakes that occur worldwide is a decreasing exponential function of their magnitude on the Richter scale. Between 2000 and 2005, there were \(7480\) earthquakes of magnitude \(5\) and \(793\) earthquakes of magnitude \(6\text{.}\) (Source: National Earthquake Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Find a formula for the number of earthquakes, \(N(m)\text{,}\) in terms of their magnitude.</li>
<li>It is difficult to keep an accurate count of small earthquakes. Use your formula to estimate the number of magnitude \(1\) earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005. How many earthquakes of magnitude \(8\) occurred?</li>
