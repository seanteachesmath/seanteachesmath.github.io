<p>A company's monthly production, \(P\text{,}\) depends on the capital, \(C\text{,}\) the company has invested and the amount of labor, \(L\text{,}\) available each month. The Cobb-Douglas model for production assumes that \(P\) varies jointly with \(C^a\) and \(L^b\text{,}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants less than \(1\text{.}\) The Aztech Chip Company invested \(625\) units of capital and hired \(256\) workers and produces \(8000\) computer chips each month.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that \(a = 0.25\text{,}\) \(b = 0.75\text{.}\) Find the constant of variation and a formula giving \(P\) in terms of \(C\) and \(L\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If Aztech increases its labor force to \(300\) workers, what production level can they expect?</p></li>
<li><p>If Aztech maintains its labor force at \(256\) workers, what amount of capital outlay would be required for monthly production to reach \(16,000\) computer chips?</p></li>
