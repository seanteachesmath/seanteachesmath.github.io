<p>Carbon-14 occurs in living organisms with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of \(5730\) years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have \(91.2\%\) of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?</p>

<p>Rubidium-strontium radioactive dating is used in geologic studies to measure the age of minerals. Rubidium-87 decays into strontium-87 with a half-life of \(48.8\) billion years. Several meteors were found to have \(93.7\%\) of their original rubidium. How old are the meteors?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">41<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Americium-241 (Am-241) is used in residential smoke detectors. Particles emitted as Am-241 decays cause the air in a smoke alarm to ionize, allowing current to flow between two electrodes. If smoke absorbs the particles, the current changes and sets off the alarm. The half-life of Am-241 is \(432\) years. How long will it take for \(30\%\) of the Am-241 to decay?</p>

<p>Doctors can measure the amount of blood in a patient by injecting a known volume of red blood cells tagged with chromium-51. After allowing the blood to mix, they measure the percentage of tagged cells in a sample of the patient's blood and use a proportion to compute the original blood volume. Chromium-51 has a half-life of \(27.7\) days. How much of the original chromium-51 will still be present after \(2\) days?</p></article>
