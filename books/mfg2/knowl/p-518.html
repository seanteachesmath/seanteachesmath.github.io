<p>We read the left-hand side as " \(f\) composed with \(g\) at \(x\text{,}\)" and the right-hand side as " \(f\) of \(g\) of \(x\)".  The two sides of the equation have the same mathematical meaning and are equal. The open circle symbol \(\circ\) is called the composition operator. We use this operator mainly when we wish to emphasize the relationship between the functions themselves without referring to any particular input value. Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a new function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new number. However, it is important not to confuse function composition with multiplication, because in most cases \(f(g(x))\neq f(x)g(x)\text{.}\)</p>
