<ul class="disc">
<li>The graph of \(r(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x + 1}{x^2}}\) in figure (a) has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = 0\text{,}\) the \(x\)-axis, because the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator. Higher powers of \(x\) grow much more rapidly than smaller powers. Thus, for large values of \(\abs{x}\text{,}\) the denominator is much larger in absolute value than the numerator of \(r(x)\text{,}\) so the function values approach \(0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The graph of \(s(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 - 4}{2x^2}}\) in figure (b) has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{,}\) because the numerator and denominator of the fraction have the same degree. For large values of \(\abs{x}\text{,}\) the terms of lower degree are negligible compared to the squared terms. As \(x\) increases, \(s(x)\) is approximately equal to \(\dfrac{x^2}{2x^2}\text{,}\) or \(\dfrac{1}{2}\text{.}\) Thus, the function values approach a constant value of \(\dfrac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The graph of \(t(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1}}\) in figure (c) does not have a horizontal asymptote, because the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. As \(\abs{x}\) increases, \(x^2 + 1\) grows much faster than \(x - 1\text{,}\) so their ratio does not approach a constant value. The function values increase without bound.</li>
