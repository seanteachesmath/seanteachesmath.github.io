<p>The Explorer's Club is planning a canoe trip to travel \(90\) miles up the Lazy River and return in \(4\) days. Club members plan to paddle for \(6\) hours each day, and they know that the current in the Lazy River is \(2\) miles per hour.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express the time it will take for the upstream journey as a function of their paddling speed in still water.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it will take for the downstream journey as a function of their paddling speed in still water.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the sum of the two functions and find the point on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(24\text{.}\) Interpret the coordinates of the point in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Explorer's Club would like to know what average paddling speed members must maintain in order to complete their trip in \(4\) days. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the required paddling speed.</p></li>
</ol>
