<p>In the 1940s, David Lack undertook a study of the European robin. He tagged \(130\) one-year-old robins and found that on average \(35.6\%\) of the birds survived each year. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>According to the data, how many robins would have originally hatched to produce \(130\) one-year-olds?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a formula for the number of the original robins still alive after \(t\) years.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph your function.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the original robins actually survived for \(9\) years. How many robins does the model predict will survive for \(9\) years?</p></li>
