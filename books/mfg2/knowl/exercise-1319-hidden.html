<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>During an advertising campaign in a large city, the makers of Chip-O’s corn chips estimate that the number of people who have heard of Chip-O’s increases by a factor of \(8\) every 4 days.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If 100 people are given trial bags of Chip-O's to start the campaign, write a function, \(N(t)\text{,}\) for the number of people who have heard of Chip-O's after \(t\) days of advertising.</li>
<li>Use your calculator to graph the function \(N(t)\) on the domain \(0 \le t \le 15\text{.}\)</li>
<li>How many days should the makers run the campaign in order for Chip-O's to be familiar to \(51,200\) people? Use algebraic methods to find your answer and verify on your graph.</li>
