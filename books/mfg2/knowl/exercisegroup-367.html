<p>Property taxes on a house vary directly with the value of the house. If the taxes on a house worth $\(120,000\) are $\(2700\text{,}\) what would the taxes be on a house assessed at $\(275,000\text{?}\)</p>

<p>The cost of electricity varies directly with the number of units (BTUs) consumed. If a typical household in the Midwest uses \(83\) million BTUs of electricity annually and pays $\(1236\text{,}\) how much will a household that uses \(70\) million BTUs annually spend for energy?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">31<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Distances on a map vary directly with actual distances. The scale on a map of Michigan uses \(\frac{3}{8} \) inch to represent \(10\) miles. If Isle Royale is \(1\frac{11}{16} \) inches long on the map, what is the actual length of the island?</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of human beings at the Hawaiian islands around 400 A.D., many species of birds became extinct. Fossils of \(29\) different species have been found, but some species may have left no fossils for us to find. We can estimate the total number of extinct species using a proportion. Of \(9\) species that are still alive, biologists have found fossil evidence of \(7\text{.}\) (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assuming that the same fraction of extinct species have left fossil records, calculate the total number of extinct species</p></li>
<li><p>Give two reasons why this estimate may not be completely accurate.</p></li>
