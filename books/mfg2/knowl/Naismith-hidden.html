<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Naismith's rule is used by runners and walkers to estimate journey times in hilly terrain. In 1892, Naismith wrote in the <span class="booktitle">Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal</span> that a person “in fair condition should allow for easy expeditions an hour for every three miles on the map, with an additional hour for every 2000 feet of ascent.” (Source: Scarf, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>According to Naismith, one unit of ascent requires the same time as how many units of horizontal travel? (Convert miles to feet.) This is called <dfn class="terminology">Naismith's number</dfn>. Round your answer to one decimal place</p></li>
<li><p>A walk in the Brecon Beacons in Wales covers \(3.75\) kilometers horizontally and climbs \(582\) meters. What is the equivalent flat distance?</p></li>
<li><p>If you can walk at a pace of \(15\) minutes per kilometer over flat ground, how long will the walk in the Brecon Beacons take?</p></li>
