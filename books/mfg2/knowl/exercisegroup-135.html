<div class="introduction"><p>The quoted material in Problems 47–50  is taken from the article "Quantum Black Holes," by Bernard J. Carr and Steven B.

<p>“The density to which matter must be squeezed [to create a black hole] scales as the inverse square of the mass. For a hole with the mass of the Sun, the density is about \(10^{19}\) kilograms per cubic meter, higher than that of an atomic nucleus.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Recall that the density of an object is its mass per unit volume. Given that the mass of the sun is about \(2\times 10^{30}\) kilograms, write a formula for the density, \(D\text{,}\) of a black hole as a function of its mass, \(m\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>“The known laws of physics allow for a matter density up to the so-called Planck value of \(10^{97}\) kilograms per cubic meter.” If a black hole with this density could be created, it would be the smallest possible black hole. What would its mass be?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that a black hole is spherical, what would be the radius of the smallest possible black hole?</p></li>

<p>“A black hole radiates thermally, like a hot coal, with a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. For a solar-mass black hole, the temperature is around a millionth of a kelvin.”</p>

<li><p>The solar mass is given in Problem 47. Write a formula for the temperature, \(T\text{,}\) of a black hole as a function of its mass, \(m\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the temperature of a black hole of mass \(10^{12}\) kilograms, about the mass of a mountain?</p></li>

<p>“The total time for a black hole to evaporate away is proportional to the cube of its initial mass. For a solar-mass hole, the lifetime is an unobservably long \(10^{64}\) years.”</p>

<li><p>The solar mass is given in Problem 47. Write a formula for the lifetime, \(L\text{,}\) of a black hole as a function of its mass, \(m\text{.}\)</p></li>

<p>“String theory \(\ldots\) predicts that space has dimensions beyond the usual three. In three dimensions, the force of  as strong.” In three dimensions, the forcgravity quadruples as you halve the distance between two objects. But in nine dimensions, gravity would get \(256\) timese of gravity varies inversely with the square of distance. Write a formula for the force of gravity in nine dimensions.</p></article>
