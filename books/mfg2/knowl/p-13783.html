<p>Suppose we have some wire fence to enclose an exercise area for rabbits, and we would like to see what dimensions are possible for different rectangles with that perimeter. In this case, it would be more useful to have a formula for the length of the rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width. We can find such a formula by solving the perimeter formula for \(l\) in terms of \(P\) and \(w\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2l + 2w \amp= P \amp\amp\blert{\text{Subtact }2 w \text{ from both sides.}}\\
2l \amp= P - 2w \amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}\\
l \amp= \frac{P - 2w}{2}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The result is a new formula that gives the length of a rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width.</p>
