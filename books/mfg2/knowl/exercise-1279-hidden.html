<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for $\(20,000\text{,}\) and \(1\) year later its value has decreased to $\(17,000\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the value decreased linearly, what was its annual rate of decrease?</p></li>
<li><p>If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the value of your car when it is \(5\) years old under each assumption, linear or exponential depreciation.</p></li>
