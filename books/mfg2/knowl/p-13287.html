<li><p>Plot the data on the grid, or use the <dfn class="terminology">StatPlot</dfn> feature on your calculator. Use your calculator to find the least squares regression line. Graph the regression line on top of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your regression line to estimate the power needed for the swimmer to overcome an opposing force of \(15\) newtons.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your regression line to estimate the power generated by the swimmer when there is no force either hindering or helping her.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate the force needed to tow the swimmer at \(0.4\) meters per second while she rests. (If she is resting, she is not generating any power).</p></li>
<li><p>The swimmer's <dfn class="terminology">mechanical</dfn> power (or rate of work) is computed by multiplying her speed times the force needed to tow her at rest. Use your answer to part (d) to calculate the mechanical power she generates by swimming at \(0.4\) meters per second.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratio of mechanical power to metabolic power is a measure of the swimmer's efficiency. Compute the efficiency of the swimmer when there is no external force opposing or helping her.</p></li>
