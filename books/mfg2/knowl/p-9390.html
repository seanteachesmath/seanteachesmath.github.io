<p>Have you ever wondered why time seems to pass more quickly as we grow older? One theory suggests that the human mind judges the length of a long period of time by comparing it with its current age. For example, a year is \(20\%\) of a \(5\)-year-old's lifetime, but only \(5\%\) of a \(20\)-year-old's, so a year feels longer to a \(5\)-year-old. Thus, psychological time follows a log scale, like the one shown in the figure.</p>
