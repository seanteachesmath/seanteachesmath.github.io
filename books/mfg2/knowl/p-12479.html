<p>We see that the first graph has an asymptote at \(x = 0\text{,}\) and the second graph has one at \(x = -2\text{.}\) It appears that the two graphs may intersect in the third quadrant, around \(x = -3\text{.}\) To investigate further, we change the window settings to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\text{Xmin} \amp = -4.55 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = -2.2\\
\text{Ymin} \amp = -1.3 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = -0.3
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">to obtain the close-up view shown in figure (b). In this window, we can see that the graphs intersect in two distinct points, and by using the Trace we find that their \(x\)-coordinates are \(x = -3\) and \(x = -4\text{.}\)</p>
