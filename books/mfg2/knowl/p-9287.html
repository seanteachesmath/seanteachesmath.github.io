<li>We read from the timeline that the Earth was formed between \(10^3\) and \(10^4\text{,}\) or between \(1000\) and \(10,000\) million years ago. We estimate that Earth formed \(5000\) million years ago.</li>
<li>The extinction of the dinosaurs is plotted between \(10^1\) and \(10^2\text{,}\) or between \(10\) and \(100\) million years ago. Because the point is closer to \(10^2\text{,}\) we estimate their extinction at \(70\) million years ago.</li>
<li>The last ice age is plotted just after \(10^{-2}\text{,}\) or \(0.01\) million years ago. One-hundredth of a million is \(10,000\text{,}\) so we estimate that the ice age occurred a little more than \(10,000\) years ago.</li>
<li>The Crusades occurred about \(10^{-3}\text{,}\) or about \(0.001\) million years ago. One-thousandth of a million is \(1000\text{,}\) so the Crusades occurred about \(1000\) years ago, or about \(1000\) A.D.</li>
