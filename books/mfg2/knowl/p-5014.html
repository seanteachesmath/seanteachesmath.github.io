<p>For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Our Sun has luminosity \(4 \times 10^{26}\) watts and mass \(2 \times 10^{30}\) kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is \(1\) solar luminosity, and its mass is \(1\) solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, \(L\text{,}\) of a star in terms of its mass, \(M\text{,}\) using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.</li>
<li>The star Sirius is \(23\) times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is \(23\) solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.</li>
