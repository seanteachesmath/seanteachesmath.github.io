<p>In a right triangle, the longest side is opposite the right angle and is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypotenuse</dfn>. Ordinarily, even if we know the lengths of two sides of a triangle, it is not easy to find the length of the third side (to solve this problem we need trigonometry), but for the special case of a right triangle, there is an equation that relates the lengths of the three sides. This property of right triangles was known to many ancient cultures, and we know it today by the name of a Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, who provided a proof of the result.</p>
