<p>Federal regulations require that 60% of all vehicles manufactured next year comply with new emission standards. Major Motors can bring 85% of its small trucks in line with the standards, but only 40% of its automobiles. If Major Motors plans to manufacture 20,000 automobiles next year, how many trucks will it have to produce in order to comply with the federal regulations?</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are we asked to find in this problem? Assign a variable to represent it.</p></li>
<li><p>Write algebraic expressions for the number of trucks and the number of cars that will meet emission standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Write two different expressions for the total number of vehicles that will meet the standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an equation and solve it.</p></li>
