<p>No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Roy Simpson and his colleagues at Cosumnes River College, especially Min Zeng and Phuong Le, for their careful reading of the text and superior error-spotting skills. We also thank Tom Judson and the faculty at Stephen F. Austin State University for their help designing WebWork exercises for the text.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
