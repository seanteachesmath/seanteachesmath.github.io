<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>Let us first look at what order you evaluate the functions: \(A(m(t))\) or \(m(A(d))\text{.}\)  A nice way to determine order is to examine input and output variables. \(A(d)\) has the input of milligrams and output of pain scale. \(m(t)\) has the input of time and output of milligrams.  This means we have to match up the output of \(m(t)\) with the input of \(A(d)\text{.}\)  Right away, this means we want option (a) or (b), since the order of composition is right. Notice, if we are asked "how long", this means we want to solve for the variable \(t\text{.}\)  The pain level is at \(3\text{,}\) which means \(A(d)=3\text{.}\)  The only way both of these is satisfied is in option (a).</p></div></body>
