<p>A biologist isolates two strains of a particular virus and monitors the growth of each, starting with samples of \(0.01\) gram. Strain A increases by \(10\%\) in \(8\) hours and strain B increases by \(12\%\) in \(9\) hours.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How much did the sample of strain A weigh after \(8\) hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li><p>How much did the sample of strain B weigh after \(9\) hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li><p>Which strain of virus grows more rapidly?</p></li>
