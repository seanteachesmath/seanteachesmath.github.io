<li><p>How many cups of cocoa were sold when the temperature was \(2\degree\)C?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the temperature on the night when \(25\) cups of cocoa were sold?</p></li>
<li><p>Use a straightedge to draw a line of best fit through the data points</p></li>
<li><p>Use your line of best fit to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold at the snack bar if the temperature is \(7\degree\)C.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose two points on your regression line and find its equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the equation to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold when the temperature is \(10\degree\)C and when the temperature is \(24\degree\)C. Are these predictions reasonable?</p></li>
