<p>Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) is a pesticide that was used in the middle decades of the twentieth century to control malaria. After 1945, it was also widely used on crops in the United States, and as much as one ton might be sprayed on a single cotton field. However, after the toxic effects of DDT on the environment began to appear, the chemical was banned in 1972.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>A common estimate for the half-life of DDT in the soil is \(15\) years. Write a decay law for DDT in the soil.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1970, many soil samples in the United States contained about \(0.5\) mg of DDT per kg of soil. The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) safe level for DDT in the soil is \(0.008\) mg/kg. When will DDT content in the soil be reduced to a safe level?</p></li>
