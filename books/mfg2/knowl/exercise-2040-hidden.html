Hedges provide some shelter for the crops and retain moisture, but they may compete for nutrients or create too much shade. Results of studies on the microclimates produced by hedges are summarized in the figure, which shows how crop yields increase or decrease as a function of distance from the hedgerow. (Source: Briggs, David, and Courtney, 1985)</p>

<li><p>We will use trial-and-improvement to fit a curve to the graph. First, graph \(y_1 = xe^{-x}\) in the window \(\text{Xmin} = -2\text{,}\) \(\text{Xmax} = 5\text{,}\) \(\text{Ymin} = -1\text{,}\) \(\text{Ymax} = 1\) to see that it has the right shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph \(y_2 = (x - 2)e^{-(x-2)}\) on the same axes. How is the graph of \(y_2\) different from the graph of \(y_1\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Next we'll find the correct scale by trying functions of the form \(y = a(x - 2)e^{-(x-2)/b}\text{.}\) Experiment with different whole number values of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) How do the values of \(a\) and \(b\) affect the curve?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph \(y = 5(x - 2)e^{-(x-2)/4}\) in the window \(\text{Xmin} = -5\text{,}\) \(\text{Xmax} = 25\text{,}\) \(\text{Ymin} = -20\text{,}\) \(\text{Ymax} = 25\text{.}\) This function is a reasonable approximation for the curve in the figure. Compare the area of decreased yield (below the \(x\)-axis) with the area of increased yield (above the \(x\)-axis). Which area is larger? Is the overall effect of hedgerows on crop yield good or bad?</p></li>
<li><p>About how far from the hedgerow do the beneficial effects extend? If the average hedgerow is about \(2.5\) meters tall, how large should the field be to exploit their advantages?</p></li>
