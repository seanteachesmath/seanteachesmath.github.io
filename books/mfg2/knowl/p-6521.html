<p>In 2003, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit against the federal government for failing to protect Alaskan sea otters. The population of sea otters, which numbered between \(150,000\) and \(300,000\) before hunting began in \(1741\text{,}\) declined from about \(20,000\) in \(1992\) to \(6000\) in \(2000\text{.}\) (Source: Center for Biological Diversity)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the population declined linearly after \(1992\text{,}\) what was its annual rate of decrease?</p></li>
<li><p>If the population declined exponentially after \(1992\text{,}\) what was its annual rate of decrease?</p></li>
<li><p>Predict the number of sea otters in \(2010\) under each assumption, linear or exponential decline</p></li>
