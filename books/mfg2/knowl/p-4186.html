<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The number of hours of daylight in Salt Lake City varies from a minimum of \(9.6\) hours on the winter solstice to a maximum of \(14.4\) hours on the summer solstice.</p></li>
<li><p>A weight is \(6.5\) feet above the floor, suspended from the ceiling by a spring. The weight is pulled down to \(5\) feet above the floor and released, rising past \(6.5\) feet in \(0.5\) second before attaining its maximum height of \(8\) feet. Neglecting the effects of friction, the height of the weight will continue to oscillate between its minimum and maximum height.</p></li>
<li><p>The voltage used in U.S. electrical current changes from \(155\) V to \(-155\) V and back \(60\) times each second.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the moon is spherical, what we can see from Earth looks like a (sometimes only partly visible) disk. The percentage of the moon's disk that is visible varies between \(0\) (at new moon) to \(100\) (at full moon).</p></li>
