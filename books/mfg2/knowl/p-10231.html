<p>All these parabolas share certain features.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in figure (a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in figure (b). This high or low point is called the <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn> of the graph.</li>
<li>The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the <dfn class="terminology">axis of symmetry</dfn>, that runs through the vertex.</li>
<li>The \(y\)-intercept is the point where the parabola intersects the \(y\)-axis. The graph of a quadratic function always has exactly one \(y\)-<dfn class="terminology">intercept</dfn>.</li>
<li>However, the graph may cross the \(x\)-axis at one point, at two points, or not at all. Points where the parabola intersects the \(x\)-axis are called the \(x\)-<dfn class="terminology">intercepts</dfn>. If there are two \(x\)-intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.</li>
<li>The values of the constants \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We will begin by considering each of these constants separately.</li>
</ul>
