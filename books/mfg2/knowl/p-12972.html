<p>A person will float in fresh water if his or her density is less than or equal to \(1\) kilogram per liter, the density of water. (Density is given by the formula \(\text{density} = \dfrac{\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}\text{.}\)) Suppose a swimmer weighs \(50 + F\) kilograms, where \(F\) is the amount of fat her body contains. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Calculate the volume of her nonfat body mass if its density is \(1.1\) kilograms per liter.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the volume of the fat if its density is \(0.901\) kilograms per liter.</p></li>
<li><p>The swimmer’s lungs hold \(2.6\) liters of air. Write an expression for the total volume of her body, including the air in her lungs.</p></li>

<li><p>Solve your equation. What percent of the swimmer's weight is fat?</p></li>
