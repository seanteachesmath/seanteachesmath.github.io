<p>Carbon dioxide (\(\text{CO}_2\)) is called a greenhouse gas because it traps part of the Earth's outgoing energy. Animals release \(\text{CO}_2\) into the atmosphere, and plants remove \(\text{CO}_2\) through photosynthesis. In modern times, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels both contribute to \(\text{CO}_2\) levels. The figure shows atmospheric concentrations of \(\text{CO}_2\text{,}\) in parts per million, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The red curve shows annual oscillations in \(\text{CO}_2\) levels. Can you explain why \(\text{CO}_2\) levels vary throughout the year?</p></li>
<li><p>The blue curve shows the average annual \(\text{CO}_2\) readings. By approximately how much does the \(\text{CO}_2\) level vary from its average value during the year?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1960, the average \(\text{CO}_2\) level was \(316.75\) parts per million, and the average level has been rising by \(0.4\%\) per year. If the level continues to rise at this rate, what \(\text{CO}_2\) readings can we expect in the year 2100?</p></li>
