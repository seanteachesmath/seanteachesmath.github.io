<p>A bicycle ergometer is used to measure the amount of power generated by a cyclist. The scatterplot shows how long an athlete was able to sustain various levels of power output. The curve is the graph of \(y = 500x^{-0.29}\text{,}\) which approximately models the data. (Source: Alexander, 1992)</p>

<li><p>In this graph, which variable is independent and which is dependent?</p></li>
<li><p>The athlete maintained \(650\) watts of power for \(40\) seconds. What power output does the equation predict for \(40\) seconds?</p></li>
<li><p>The athlete maintained \(300\) watts of power for \(10\) minutes. How long does the equation predict that power output can be maintained?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1979, a remarkable pedal-powered aircraft called the Gossamer Albatross was successfully flown across the English Channel. The flight took \(3\) hours. According to the equation, what level of power can be maintained for \(3\) hours?</p></li>
<li><p>The Gossamer Albatross needed \(250\) watts of power to keep it airborne. For how long can \(250\) watts be maintained according to the given equation?</p></li>
