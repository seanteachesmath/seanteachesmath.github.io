<p>Manufacturers of ships (and other complex products) find that the average cost of producing a ship decreases as more of those ships are produced. This relationship is called the <dfn class="terminology">experience curve</dfn>, given by the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = ax^{-b}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(C\) is the average cost per ship in millions of dollars and \(x\) is the number of ships produced. The value of the constant \(b\) depends on the complexity of the ship. (Source: Storch, Hammon, and Bunch, 1988)</p>

<li><p>What is the significance of the constant of proportionality \(a\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>For one kind of ship, \(b = \dfrac{1}{8}\text{,}\) and the cost of producing the first ship is \(\$12\) million. Write the equation for \(C\) as a function of \(x\) using radical notation.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the cost per ship when \(2\) ships have been built. By what percent does the cost per ship decrease? By what percent does the cost per ship decrease from building \(2\) ships to building \(4\) ships?</p></li>
<li><p>By what percent does the average cost decrease from building \(n\) ships to building \(2n\) ships? (In the shipbuilding industry, the average cost per ship usually decreases by \(5\) to \(10\%\) each time the number of ships doubles.)</p></li>
