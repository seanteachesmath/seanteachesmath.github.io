<p>From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to \(1\) ounce require $0.47 postage. This means that for all \(w\)-values greater than \(0\) but less than or equal to \(1\text{,}\) the \(p\)-value is \(0.47\text{.}\) Thus, the graph of \(p = g(w)\) between \(w = 0\) and \(w = 1\) looks like a small piece of the horizontal line \(p = 0.47\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Similarly, for all \(w\)-values greater than \(1\) but less than or equal to \(2\text{,}\) the \(p\)-value is \(0.68\text{,}\) so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line \(p = 0.68\text{.}\) Continue in this way to obtain the graph shown below.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/fig-postage-2016.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="postage step function"></div></div></div>
<p>The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if \(w = 3\text{,}\) the postage, \(p\text{,}\) is $0.89, not $1.10. Consequently, the point \((3, 0.89)\) is part of the graph of \(g\text{,}\) but the point \((3, 1.10)\) is not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Postage rates are given for all weights greater than \(0\) ounces up to and including \(7\) ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval \((0, 7]\text{.}\) (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every \(w\)-value from \(0\) to \(7\text{.}\))</p>
<p>The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for \(p\) do not include all the real numbers between \(0.3\) and \(1.75\text{.}\) The range is the set of discrete values \(0.47\text{,}\) \(0.68\text{,}\) \(0.89\text{,}\) \(1.10\text{,}\) \(1.31\text{,}\) \(1.52\text{,}\) and \(1.73\text{.}\)</p>
