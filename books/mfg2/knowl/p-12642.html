<p>A chartered sightseeing flight over the Grand Canyon is scheduled to return to its departure point in \(3\) hours. The pilot would like to cover a distance of \(144\) miles before turning around, and he hears on the Weather Service that there will be a headwind of \(20\) miles per hour on the outward journey.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express the time it takes for the outward journey as a function of the airspeed of the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it takes for the return journey as a function of the speed of the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the sum of the two functions and find the point on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(3\text{.}\) Interpret the coordinates of the point in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The pilot would like to know what airspeed to maintain in order to complete the tour in \(3\) hours. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the appropriate airspeed.</p></li>
</ol>
