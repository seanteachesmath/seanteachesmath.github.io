<p><a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/balloons.html" title="Investigation 3.0.1: Inflating a Balloon">InvestigationÂ 3.0.1</a> at the start of this chapter gives data for the pressure inside April and Tolu's balloon as a function of its diameter. As the diameter of the balloon increases from \(5\) cm to \(20\) cm, the pressure inside decreases. Can we find a function that describes this portion of the graph?</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Pressure is the force per unit area exerted by the balloon on the air inside, or \(P = \dfrac{F}{A}\text{.}\) Because the balloon is spherical, its surface area, \(A\text{,}\) is given by \(A = \pi d^2\text{.}\) Because the force increases as the balloon expands, we will try a power function \(F = kd^p\text{,}\) where \(k\) and \(p\) are constants, and see if this fits the data. Combine the three equations, \(P = \dfrac{F}{A}\text{,}\) \(A = \pi d^2\text{,}\) and \(F = kd^p\text{,}\) to express \(P\) as a power function of \(d\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use your calculator's power regression feature to find a power function that fits the data. Graph the function \(P = 211d^{-0.7}\) on top of the data. Do the data support the hypothesis that \(P\) is a power function of \(d\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of the exponent \(p\) in \(F = kd^p\text{?}\)</p></li>
