<p>If you walk in the normal way, your maximum speed, \(v\text{,}\) in meters per second, is limited by the length of your legs, \(r\text{,}\) according to the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
v=\sqrt{gr} 
\end{equation*}

<li><p>A typical adult man has legs about \(0.9\) meter long. How fast can he walk?</p></li>

<li><p>Race-walkers can walk as fast as \(4.4\) meters per second by rotating their hips so that the effective length of their legs is increased. What is that effective length?</p></li>
