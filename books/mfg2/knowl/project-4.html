<p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a mountain range on the sea floor beneath the Atlantic Ocean. It was discovered in the late nineteenth century during the laying of transatlantic telephone cables. The ridge is volcanic, and the ocean floor is moving away from the ridge on either side.</p>
<p>Geologists have estimated the speed of this sea-floor spreading by recording the age of the rocks on the sea floor and their distance from the ridge. (The age of the rocks is calculated by measuring their magnetic polarity. At known intervals over the last four million years, the Earth reversed its polarity, and this information is encoded in the rocks.) (Source: Open University, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>According to the table, rocks that are \(0.78\) million years old have moved \(17\) kilometers from the ridge. What was the speed of spreading over the past \(0.78\) million years? (This is the rate of spreading closest to the ridge.)</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the data in the table, with age on the horizontal axis and separation distance on the vertical axis. Draw a line of best fit through the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the slope of the regression line. What are the units of the slope?</p></li>
<li><p>The slope you calculated in part (c) represents the average spreading rate over the past \(3.58\) million years. Is the average rate greater or smaller than the rate of spreading closest to the ridge?</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the average spreading rate to millimeters per year</p></li>
