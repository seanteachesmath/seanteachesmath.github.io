<li><p>From the graph we see that the pressure has dropped to \(18\) inches of mercury at about \(14,000\) feet, and that it continues to decrease as the altitude increases. Therefore, the pressure is less than \(18\) inches of mercury for altitudes greater than \(14,000\) feet.</p></li>
<li><p>The pressure at \(15,000\) feet is approximately \(17.4\) inches of mercury, and at \(25,000\) feet it is \(12\) inches. This represents a decrease in pressure of \(17.4 - 12\text{,}\) or \(5.4\text{,}\) inches of mercury.</p></li>
<li><p>By studying the graph we see that the pressure decreases most rapidly at low altitudes, so we conclude that the greatest drop in pressure occurs between \(0\) and \(10,000\) feet.</p></li>
