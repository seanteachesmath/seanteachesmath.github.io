<p>The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function, and students should acquire a good understanding of functions before they embark on their study of college-level mathematics. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1 and explore the different families of functions in subsequent chapters.</p>
