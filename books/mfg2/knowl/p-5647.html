<p>A brewery wants to replace its old vats with larger ones. To estimate the cost of the new equipment, the accountant uses the \(0.6\) rule for industrial costs, which states that the cost of a new container is approximately \(N = Cr^{0.6}\text{,}\) where \(C\) is the cost of the old container and \(r\) is the ratio of the capacity of the new container to the old one.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an old vat cost \(\$5000\text{,}\) graph \(N\) as a function of \(r\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>How much should the accountant budget for a new vat that holds \(1.8\) times as much as the old one?</p></li>
</ol>
