<p>Jack invests $\(500\) in an account bearing interest rate \(r\text{,}\) compounded annually. This means that each year his account balance is increased by a factor of \(1 + r\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write expressions for the amount of money in Jack's account after \(2\) years, after \(3\) years, and after \(4\) years.</p></li>
<li>Expand as polynomials the expressions you found in part (a).</li>
<li><p>How much money will be in Jack's account at the end of \(2\) years, \(3\) years, and \(4\) years if the interest rate is \(8\%\text{?}\)</p></li>
