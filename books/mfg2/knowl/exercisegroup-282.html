<p>A mountain climber stands on a ledge \(80\) feet above the ground and tosses a rope down to a companion clinging to the rock face below the ledge. The initial velocity of the rope is \(-8\) feet per second, and the value of \(g\) is \(32\text{.}\)</p>

<li><p>Write a quadratic equation that gives the height of the rope at time \(t\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the height of the rope after \(\dfrac{1}{2} \) second? After \(1\) second?</p></li>
<li><p>Write and solve an equation to answer the question: How long does it take the rope to reach the second climber, who is \(17\) feet above the ground?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Table feature on your calculator to verify your answers to parts (b) and (c). (What value of \(\Delta \text{Tbl}\) is useful for this problem?)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph your equation from part (a) on your calculator. Use your table to help you choose an appropriate window.</p></li>
<li><p>If the second climber misses the rope, approximately how long will the rope take to reach the ground?</p></li>
