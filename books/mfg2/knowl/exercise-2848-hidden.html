<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>A person will float in fresh water if his or her density is less than or equal to \(1\) kilogram per liter, the density of water. (Density is given by the formula \(\text{density} = \dfrac{\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}\text{.}\)) Suppose a swimmer weighs \(50 + F\) kilograms, where \(F\) is the amount of fat her body contains. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
