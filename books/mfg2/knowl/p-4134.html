<li><p>When the heart contracts, blood pressure in the arteries rises rapidly to a peak (systolic blood pressure) and then falls off quickly to a minimum (diastolic blood pressure). Blood pressure is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>After an injection is given to a patient, the amount of the drug present in his bloodstream decreases exponentially. The patient receives injections at regular intervals to restore the drug level to the prescribed level. The amount of the drug present is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The monorail shuttle train between the north and south terminals at Gatwick Airport departs from the south terminal every 12 minutes. The distance from the train to the south terminal is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Delbert gets a haircut every two weeks. The length of his hair is a periodic function of time.</p></li>

<p>A patient receives regular doses of medication to maintain a certain level of the drug in his body. After each dose, the patient's body eliminates a certain percent of the medication before the next dose is administered. The graph shows the amount of the drug, in milliliters, in the patient's body as a function of time in hours.</p>

<p>You are sitting on your front porch late one evening, and you see a light coming down the road tracing out the path shown below, with distances in inches. You realize that you are seeing a bicycle light, fixed to the front wheel of the bike.</p>

<p>The graph shows arterial blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), as a function of time.</p>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are the maximum (systolic) and minimum (diastolic) pressures? The <dfn class="terminology">pulse pressure</dfn> is the difference of systolic and diastolic pressures. What is the pulse pressure?</p></li>
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">mean arterial pressure</dfn> is the diastolic pressure plus one-third of the pulse pressure. Calculate the mean arterial pressure and draw a horizontal line on the graph at that pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>The blood pressure graph repeats its cycle with each heartbeat. What is the heart rate, in beats per minute, of the person whose blood pressure is shown in the graph?</p></li>

<p>At a ski slope, the lift chairs take 5 minutes to travel from the bottom, at an elevation of 3000 feet, to the top, at elevation 4000 feet. The cable supporting the ski lift chairs is a loop turning on pulleys at a constant speed. At the top and bottom, the chairs are at a constant elevation for a few seconds to allow skiers to get on and off.</p>

<li><p>Sketch a graph of \(h(t)\text{,}\) the height of one chair at time \(t\text{.}\) Show at least two complete up-and-down trips.</p></li>

<p>The heater in Paul's house doesnâ€™t have a thermostat; it runs on a timer. It uses \(300\) watts when it is running. Paul sets the heater to run from 6 a.m. to noon, and again from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
