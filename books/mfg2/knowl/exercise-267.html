<p>Niagara Falls was discovered by Father Louis Hennepin in 1682. In 1952, much of the water of the Niagara River was diverted for hydroelectric power, but until that time erosion caused the Falls to recede upstream by \(3\) feet per year.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How far did the Falls recede from 1682 to 1952?</p></li>
<li><p>The Falls were formed about \(12,000\) years ago during the end of the last ice age. How far downstream from their current position were they then? (Give your answer in miles.)</p></li>
