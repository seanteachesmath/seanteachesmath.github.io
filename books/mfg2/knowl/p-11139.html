<p>Starlings often feed in flocks, and their rate of feeding depends on the size of the flock. If the flock is too small, the birds are nervous and spend a lot of time watching for predators. If the flock is too large, the birds become overcrowded and fight each other, which interferes with feeding. Here are some data gathered at a feeding station. The data show the number of starlings in the flock and the total number of pecks per minute recorded at the station while the flock was feeding. (Source: Chapman &amp; Reiss, 1992)</p>
