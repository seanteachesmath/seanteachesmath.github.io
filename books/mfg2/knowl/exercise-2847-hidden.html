Knowing the rate at which an animal (or population of animals) eats can help us determine its metabolic rate or its impact on its habitat. The rate of eating is proportional to the availability of food in the area, but it has an upper limit imposed by mechanical considerations, such as how long it takes the animal to capture and ingest its prey. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Sketch a graph of eating rate as a function of quantity of available food. This will be a qualitative graph only; you do not have enough information to put scales on the axes.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the rate at which an animal catches its prey is proportional to the number of prey available, or \(r_c = ax\text{,}\) where \(a\) is a constant and \(x\) is the number of available prey. The rate at which it handles and eats the prey is constant, \(r_h = b\text{.}\) Write expressions for \(T_c\) and \(T_h\text{,}\) the times for catching and handling \(N\) prey.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Show that the rate of food consumption is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y=\dfrac{abx}{b+ax}=\frac{bx}{b/a+x} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation"><em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: \(y=\dfrac{N}{T} \text{,}\) where \(N\) is the number of prey consumed in the interval \(T\text{,}\) where \(T=T_c+T_h\text{.}\)</p>

<p>In a study of ladybirds, it was discovered that larvae in their second stage of development consumed aphids at a rate \(y_2\) aphids per day, given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y_2=\frac{20x}{x+16}
