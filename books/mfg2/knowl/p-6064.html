<p>In his hiking guidebook, <span class="booktitle">Afoot and Afield in Los Angeles County</span>, Jerry Schad notes that the number of people on a wilderness trail is inversely proportional to "the square of the distance and the cube of the elevation gain from the nearest road."</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Choose variables and write a formula for this relationship.</p></li>
<li>
<p>On a sunny Saturday afternoon, you count \(42\) people enjoying the Rock Pool at Malibu Creek State Park. The Rock Pool is \(1.5\) miles from the main parking lot, and the trail includes an elevation gain of \(250\) feet. Calculate the constant of variation in your formula from part (a).</p>

<li><p>Lookout Trail leads \(1.9\) miles from the parking lot and involves an elevation gain of \(500\) feet. How many people would you expect to encounter at the end of the trail?</p></li>
