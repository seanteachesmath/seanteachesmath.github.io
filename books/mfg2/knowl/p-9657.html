<p>Galileo had no accurate way to measure time; clocks had not been invented yet. So he used water running into a jar to mark equal time intervals. After many trials, Galileo found that the ball traveled \(1\) unit of distance down the plane in the first time interval, \(3\) units in the second time interval, \(5\) units in the third time interval, and so on, as shown in the figure, with the distances increasing through odd units of distance as time went on.</p>
