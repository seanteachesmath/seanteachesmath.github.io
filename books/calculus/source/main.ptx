<title>Limits</title>

<section>
<title>Concept of a limit</title>
<p>The value, if any, that function values approach (in the <m>y</m>-direction) as the arguments approach a particular number (in the <m>x</m>-direction).  If, from both sides of a particular <m>x</m>-value, the function approaches a particular <m>y</m>-value, then that value is the limit.  If, from both sides of a particular argument, the function increases (or decreases) without bound, we say the limit is <m>\infty</m> (or <m>-\infty</m>).  If the limits from both sides differ, we say the two-sided limit does not exist (DNE).</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Limits can be calculated algebraically or read from a graph.</p></li>
<li><p> Points on graphs marked by open circles indicate a function is not defined by that <m>y</m>-value.  Points on graphs marked by closed or filled circles indicate a function is defined by that <m>y</m>-value.  </p></li>
<li><p> The two-sided limit takes its value when the values of the two one-sided limits match.  Verify that we would conclude that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{1}{x^2} = \infty</m>, but <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{1}{x} = \text{D.N.E}</m>.</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Computing limits</title>
<p><title>Limits involving zero</title> If, when attempting to evaluate by substitution, a limit of a rational function is of the form:</p>
<ul>
<li><title>form "<m>\frac{0}{\#}</m>"</title><p> the value of the limit is <m>0</m></p></li>
<li><title>form "<m>\frac{0}{0}</m>"</title><p> the expression in the limit can be simplified by factoring, rationalization</p></li>
<li><title>form "<m>\frac{\#}{0}</m>"</title><p> the value of the limit technically does not exist and must be investigated by one-sided limits and/or a test of signs to determine if the value is <m>\pm\infty</m> or DNE</p></li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Limits at infinity</title>
<ul>
<li><title>end behavior</title><p> power functions (those of the form <m>f(x) = x^n</m> for <m>n>0</m>) approach <m>\infty</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>. Those with even powers approach <m>\infty</m> as <m>x\to-\infty</m>, while those with odd powers approach <m>-\infty</m> as <m>x\to-\infty</m> </p></li>
<li><title>leading terms</title><p> for limits of rational functions, it is sufficient to take the limit of the ratio of leading terms</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Continuity</title>
<ul>
<li><title>limits</title><p> By definition of continuity at a point <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)</m>, meaning we can easily evaluate limits of continuous functions by direct substitution (i.e., function evaluation)</p></li>
<li><title>discontinuity</title><p> Functions may have jump discontinuities (piecewise functions), holes or removable discontinuities (common factors of zero on top and bottom), infinite discontinuities (division of a number by zero)</p></li>

<section>
<title>Rates of change</title>
<p>Given a function <m>f(x)</m> and two points <m>(x, f(x))</m> and <m>(x+h, f(x+h))</m>,
<ul>
<li><title>avg. r.o.c:</title><p> <m>\displaystyle m_{sec} = \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> gives the slope of the secant line connecting these points on the graph of the function and describes the average rate of change of the function over the interval</p></li>
<li><title>inst. r.o.c:</title><p> <m>\displaystyle m_{tan} = f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h\to0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> gives the slope of the tangent line touching the graph at a point <m>(x, f(x))</m> by the \textit{limit definition of the derivative} and describes the instantaneous rate of change of the function at the point</p></li>
</ul>
Notice that <m>\displaystyle m_{tan} = \lim_{h\to0} m_{sec}</m>.

<title>Basic derivatives</title>
<ul>
<li><title>power rule</title><p> <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(x^n\right) = nx^{n-1}</m> (multiply by the old power, then reduce the power by one)</p></li>
<li><title>polynomials</title><p> Polynomials can be differentiated term by term by repeated application of the power rule to each term.</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Products and Quotients</title>
<ul>
<li><title>product rule</title><p> <m>\displaystyle \dfrac{d}{dx}\left(F(x)S(x)\right) = F(x)S'(x) + S(x)F'(x)</m></p></li>
<li><title>quotient rule</title><p> <m>\displaystyle \dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\dfrac{T(x)}{B(x)}\right) = \dfrac{B(x)T'(x) - T(x)B'(x)}{(B(x))^2}</m></p></li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Trigonometric functions (limits and derivative)</title>
<p>
<ul>
<li><p> Derivatives of sine and cosine can be calculated by the definition.</p></li>
<li><p> Derivatives of the other trigonometric functions can be calculated by the quotient rule.</p></li>
</ul>
But, doing so requires an understanding of special limits of trigonometric functions.
</p>

<p>The following two special limits are each of the form <m>\dfrac{0}{0}</m> and show up when applying the limit definition of the derivative to trigonometric functions,
<ul>
<li><p> <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1</m></p></li>
<li><p> <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{1-\cos(x)}{x} = 0</m></p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Since sines and cosines are continuous, we can move the limit inside the sine or cosine, take the limit of the terms inside, and finally evaluate the sine or cosine, 
<me>\begin{aligned}
\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\sin\left(\dfrac{3\pi x^5+ \text{lower order terms}}{2x^5+\text{lower order terms}}\right)
\amp = \sin\left(\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{3\pi x^5+\dots}{2x^5+\dots}\right)\\
\amp = \sin\left(\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{3\pi x^5}{2x^5}\right)\\
\amp = \sin\left(\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\right)\\
\amp = \dots
\end{aligned}</me>
To finish the problem take the limit then evaluate the sine.

<title>Chain Rule, implicit differentiation, and related rates</title>

<p>For derivatives of compositions <m>\displaystyle \dfrac{d}{dx}\left(f(g(x))\right) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dg}\cdot\dfrac{dg}{dx}</m></p>

<p>
Implicit differentiation, an application of the chain rule, is useful when a relationship is defined by an equation too complicated (or inconvenient) to solve for <m>y</m>. 
<ul>
<li><p> We differentiate each side of an equation and solve for <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> One application of this is to find slopes or equations of lines tangent to complicated curves at points on those curves.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
Applications of implicit differentiation and the chain rule, related rates problems are used to relate two rates of change by an underlying formula or geometric relationship.  This is done with a 5-step process that includes a picture.</p>

<section>
<title>Antiderivatives and indefinite integrals</title>
<p>We are interested in determining <m>\displaystyle \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(\,\,?\,\,\Big) = f(x)</m>. 
<ul>
<li><title>antiderivatives</title><p> We call the function <m>F(x)</m> an antiderivative, and write <m>\displaystyle F(x) = \int f(x)\,dx</m>. </p></li>
<li><title>indefinite integral</title><p> The collection of all possible antiderivatives is called the indefinite integral <m>\displaystyle \int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + c</m>. </p></li>
<li><title>power rule</title><p> For <m>n\neq1</m>, <m>\displaystyle \int x^n\,dx = \dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c</m> (add one to the power, then divide by the new power).</p></li>
</ul>

<section>

<title><m>u</m>-substitution</title>
<p>This classic technique is used to evaluate more complicated integrals.  We choose <m>u = g(x)</m> and compute the differential <m>du = g'(x)dx</m>. We substitute these into the original integral, and translate from <m>x</m> and <m>dx</m> to <m>u</m> and <m>du</m>.  In substituting,
<ul>
<li><p> we sometimes have to multiply or divide both sides of the definition for <m>du</m> by a constant.  We \textit{never} solve completely for <m>dx</m> by dividing by expressions involving <m>x</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> Sometimes, for complicated problems, we are required to solve <m>u = g(x)</m> for <m>x</m> as part of the substitution step.</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Riemann sums, summation notation, and definite integrals</title>
<ul>
<li><title>Riemann sums</title><p> The area under a function (above the axis) can be approximated by collections of rectangles, this idea is used to define the definite integral.</p></li>
<li><title>algebra of sums</title><p> In making the exact calculation, the manipulation of sums is necessary.</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p> <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n k = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}</m> (\textit{If the original lower index is not <m>k=1</m>, a change of index must be performed!})</p></li>
<li><p> <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n c = nc</m> (\textit{Repeated addition gives rise to multiplication.})</p></li>
<li><p> <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \left(f(x) \pm g(x)\right) = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n f(x)\right) \pm \left(\sum_{k=1}^ng(x)\right)</m> (\textit{The sum of a sum or difference is the sum or difference of the sums.})</p></li>
</ul>
<li><title>net signed area</title><p> Tegions below the axis give rise to negative signed areas, the net signed area for a function over a region indicates whether there is more area above or below the axis.</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>

<section>
<title>Intervals of increasing, decreasing, and concavity</title>
<ul>
<li><title>critical point</title><p> a location where the derivative is zero or undefined</p></li>
<ul>
<li><title>stationary point</title><p> a location where the derivative is zero, a special type of critical point</p></li>
<li><title>undefined derivatives</title><p> may occur, for example, with rational functions where the denominator is zero. To identify, set the denominator equal to zero and attempt to solve.</p></li>
</ul>
<li><title>inflection point</title><p> a location where the second derivative is zero and the function changes concavity</p></li>
<li><title>increase/decrease</title><p> specified on closed intervals, where possible, this is indicated by the sign of the first derivative (derivative is positive, function is increasing; derivative is negative, function is decreasing) </p></li>
<li><title>concavity</title><p> specified only on open intervals, this is indicated by the sign of the second derivative (second derivative is positive, function is concave up; second derivative is negative, function is concave down) </p></li>
</ul>
