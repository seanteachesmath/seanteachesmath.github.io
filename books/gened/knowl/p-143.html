<p>Quadratic functions show up frequently in applications, for example in physics. We often study problems such as \(s(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t +
12\) where \(s(t)\) represents the height of an object thrown from a height of \(12 \text{meters}\) with an initial velocity of \(10
\text{meters
per second}\text{.}\) Because the number in front of \(t^2\) is negative, the graph of the corresponding parabola opens downward (as an upside down `u'). There are a few ways that we can learn a little more about the graph to determine the position of the curve within the \(t-s\) plane (that is, in a plot of \(s\) against \(t\)).</p>
