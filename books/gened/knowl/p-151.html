<p>The results in Tab. XX (are not shown because they weren't particularly helpful) suggests that the height is initially increasing (by the exact values, or by the approximation). The approximation, neglecting the contribution of the \(t^2\) term for small values of \(t\) suggests that the position initially increases in an approximately linear fashion. At some point though, the quadratic term starts to play a role. It seems quite strange that \(s(10) = -378\text{,}\) this would suggest that the object is \(378 \text{meters}\) below the surface of the ground. It should be the case that at some point prior, the model stops making sense. In fact, we could use the quadratic formula to determine when the object lands. Solving for \(s(t) = 0\) gives the value(s) of time \(t\) for which the height from the ground is zero.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t]
x \amp= \dfrac{-10\pm\sqrt{10^2 - 4(-4.9)(12)}}{2(-4.9)}\\
\amp = \dfrac{-10\pm\sqrt{335.2}}{-9.8}\\
x \amp = -0.847,\,\,2.889\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The negative value does not make as much sense because this suggests that the object was on the ground \text{before} we threw it upwards - we are only really concerned with the future after \(t=0\text{.}\) From our hodge-podge analysis we have that the object starts from a height of \(12 \text{meters}\text{,}\) increases approximately linearly for a brief span, and with the shape of a parabola eventually comes back down and lands at \(t\approx2.899\text{.}\) The mathematical equation is valid for all time, but after this the equation as a mathematical object of the flight of the object stops making sense.</p>
