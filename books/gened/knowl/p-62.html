<p>Sometimes we say \(y = f(x)\) to indicate that a particular function \(f(x)\) generates a value called \(y\text{,}\) to form an ordered pair \((x,
y)\text{.}\) Occasionally we try to use more meaningful symbols than \(y\text{,}\) \(f\text{,}\) and \(x\text{.}\) For example, in discussing our pace we could somewhat generically write a function \(f(x) = 0.3218x\text{.}\) This gives very little insight into the meaning of the symbol \(x\) or the result of the calculation. We might then say \(p = f(x) = 0.3218\text{,}\) just as we have said \(y = f(x) =0.3218\) in many instances before. Better yet would be \(p = p(x) = 0.3218\text{,}\) where the function and variable name are the same - one fewer thing to keep track of - and indicative of the measurement of `pace'. Better <em class="emphasis">still</em> would be \(p = p(t) = 0.3218t\) were the variable \(t\) could be a reminder of the measurement of time.</p>
