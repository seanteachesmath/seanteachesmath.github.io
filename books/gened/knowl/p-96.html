<p>For example, what is the \(\sqrt{3}\text{?}\) At the start we might observe that \(1\cdot1 = 1\) and \(2\cdot2=4\text{.}\) We might believe that the answer, the number that we multiply by itself to result in a value of \(3\text{,}\) should be between \(1\) and \(2\text{,}\) perhaps even a little closer to \(2\) than to \(1\text{.}\) In a very surprising coincidence, the mathematical technique, and even the more general approach, that lets us approximate \(\sqrt{3}\) is actually the same as the one that generated our fractals. A technique called Newton's Method, when applied to this problem, gives a mathematical rule for calculating a sequence of approximations to a square root. The rule is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x_{n+1} =
\frac{1}{2}\left(x_n+\frac{\alpha}{x_n}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(x_n\) is the \(n^\text{th}\) approximation to the square root. We imagine \(x_n\) as a sequence (or ordered list) of numbers starting at \(n=0\) with a value \(x_0\) and continuing as \(n\) grows by one at a time.</p>
