<p>Way back when we discussed numbers, first the counting numbers, we saw we could add and multiply and remain within that set of numbers. Introducing subtraction required us to think about negative number (and zero). Introducing division required us to think about rational numbers and decimals (and soon after irrational numbers). Assuming we are interested in calculating square roots of numbers in order to identify what number can be multiplied twice to generate another, we have to prepare for yet another complication. If we think of the square root arising in the problem</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(\underline{\quad})(\underline{\quad}) =
25
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">we might recognize that a number that can be used in both blanks simultaneously is \(5\)\footnote{It turns out that \(-5\) is a valid choice as well, since \((-5)(-5) = 25\) also.}. Picturing this multiplication problem we can think of other pairs of similarly related numbers also,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[t]
({5})({5}) \amp= 25\\
({3})({3}) \amp= 9\\
({-1})({-1}) \amp= 1\\
({-3})({-3}) \amp = 9
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">It turns out that there are two ways to generate the value \(9\) by multiplication: of a \(3\) with itself and of a \(-3\) with itself. We write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{9} = \pm3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">in order to indicate both possibilities. One thing we might notice is that two positive factors yield in a positive result, but so do two negative factors. A question is, ''what, if anything, can we multiply against itself to generate a negative result?''</p>
