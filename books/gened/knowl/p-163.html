<p>In some sense power functions are simpler than polynomials, they only contain a single term. But often that term is less familiar than those that occur in polynomials. For example, we might be interested in \(f(x)
= x^{0.5}\) or \(g(x) = x^{0.75}\) where are non-integer powers of the variable of interest. These functions take on very different shapes and are useful in a variety of situations. The square root function is an example of a power function \(\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}\) which has the shape of a `sideways parabola', \(x^1 = x\) is another (a straight line), \(x^2\) which has the shape of a normal parabola, as well as \(x\) raised to any other power. We can also put a constant factor out in front, for example</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = 1.4x^{0.24}
\end{equation*}
</div>
