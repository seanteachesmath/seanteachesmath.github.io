<p>With this square arrangement of numbers, the matrix, we enter the field of <em class="emphasis">linear algebra</em> (note: very closely associated with linear algebra, especially in two dimensions, is the study of <em class="emphasis">differential equations</em>). Linear algebra plays an essential role in differential equations, and by association, so does the quadratic formula.} which is broadly concerned with techniques for solving linear systems of equations. Often we are less concerned with the solutions to linear systems and we are more concerned with properties of the matrix itself. One such property of the matrix actually requires us to calculate solutions to an associated quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. To say it again, there is a direct connection between 2D matrices (2 rows, 2 columns) and the quadratic formula.</p>
