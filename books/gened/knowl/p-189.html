<p>When modeling spread of something infectious (a pathogen, a rumor, a behavior) we break a population into relevant groups.  One of the simplest breakdowns is into groups of</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>susceptible (these are the `healthy' people)</p></li>
<li><p>infectious</p></li>
<li><p>recovered</p></li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">There are some subtleties here that I will mention, but not spend any more time on.  The name of the group `infectious' suggests that these individuals are not only \textit{infected}, but are also capable of transmitting their infection to others. The `recovered' group is sometimes called `removed' to indicate the group of individuals that are \textit{removed} from the process of infection either by natural recovery or death.</p>
