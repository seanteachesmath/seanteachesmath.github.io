<p>Imagine referring to the calculation of the quantity \((50+x)(50+x)\text{,}\) it would be a bit of a drag if, any time that we wanted to make reference to the calculation, we had to refer to the complete formula. Instead we could assign this special calculation to a function \(f(x) =
(50+x)(50+x)\text{,}\) at which point we could refer to our action by either the formula or the function name. Setting \(x = 3\) and calculating we could say ''lets take the quantity \(50\) plus \(3\) times the quantity \(50\) plus \(3\)'' to calculate a particular value. As a much more convenient alternative we could simply say \(f(3)\text{,}\) the value of the function whose formula defines the calculation.</p>
