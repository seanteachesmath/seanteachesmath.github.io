<p>Thinking of a formula such as \(y = 3x-7\) we remind ourselves that there are two things we can do: `plug in' or solve an equation. Suppose we know that \(x = 4\text{,}\) what can we do with this information? We can evaluate right-hand side to say that when \(x=4\text{,}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = 3(4)- 7 =
12 -
7 = 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Often when we talk about such formulas we think of them as functions, for example, we might prefer to say \(y = f(x) = 3x-7\text{.}\) This really just says we generate a set of function values \(y\) that correspond to the set of values \(x\text{.}\) In this case we might revisit our earlier problem with the notation that \(f(4) = 3(4)-7 = 12\text{.}\) We have `plugged in' the value \(x=4\) on each side of the function, on the left as a particular value of its argument and on the right in each position that the argument occurs.</p>
