<p>The <em class="emphasis">simplest</em> example of a mathematical model, represented by the diagram in <span>(((Unresolved xref, reference "fig-sir"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute)))</span><a href="" class="internal" title="">Â </a>, tracks the amount of a population that is susceptible to infection and those that have the infection and are infectious. The Greek symbols in the diagram denote <em class="emphasis">parameters</em> and each symbol is acting as placeholder for a particular number that is important to understanding how the possible outbreak unfolds. Of the two numbers, \(\beta\) is slightly more complicated and attempts to summarize how frequently individuals interact and how likely it is that one of those interactions results in transmission; \(\gamma\) is less complicated and reflects how long a person remains infectious (i.e., it describes a `recovery rate').</p>
