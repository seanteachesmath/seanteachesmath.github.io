<p>We could start by graphing one of these, perhaps the second, whose graph is a straight line with slope of \(m=-\sfrac{5}{4}\) and \(y\)-intercept of \(b=\sfrac{9}{4}\text{.}\) The graph of the line starts at a value of \(\sfrac{9}{4}\) on the \(y\)-axis, from there we go down \(5\) units for every \(5\) units we move to the right (we could also picture going down \(\sfrac{5}{4}\) units for every \(1\) we move to the right). We could superimpose a graph of the other and identify the intersection, which corresponds to the solution to the system of equations.</p>
