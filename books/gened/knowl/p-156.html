<p>Side-by-side, the graph of \(f(x) = x^3\) is relatively less interesting than that of \(g(x) = x^3 - x\text{.}\) Given a sketch, it appears that \(x^3\) only has one zero, while \(x^3-x\) has three zeroes. In general it isn't as easy to use something like the quadratic formula for solutions to polynomial equations with higher powers. Here however, we get a bit lucky and can do some factoring of \(x^3-x\text{.}\) It turns out that in solving this, we can write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x(x^2-1)= 0 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">as a first step. To solve this equation either factor can be zero. From the first factor we have \(x=0\text{,}\) additionally from the second we can solve \(x^2-1=0\) to find the locations of other solutions. We have three strategies, guessing solutions, attempting to factor, or applying the quadratic formula (the second equation is a quadratic after all).</p>
