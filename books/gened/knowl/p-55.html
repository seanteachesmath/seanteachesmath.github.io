<p>It is worth pointing out that we spend most of our time in math classes (and other classes) looking at problems that we can solve exactly and to a unique answer. This is not the case in almost any real situation. Approximation is valid and valuable as a strategy, we do just need to be aware of the error we introduce and its consequences. Entire fields of advanced mathematics are devoted to such issues. The limitations of doing arithmetic on base-2 computers? That is a big part of numerical analysis. How important is a specific (and often `small') term in a great big formula? That is a big part of perturbation theory.</p>
