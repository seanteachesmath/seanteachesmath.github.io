<p>''Two wrong a make a right'' A pattern of decreasing numbers multiplied by a factor of \(-1\) illustrates that \((-1)\times(-1)\) is expected to be \(1\text{.}\) It might make sense to think of \((3)\times(-1)\) as \((-1) + (-1) + (-1)\text{.}\) Including negative (whole) numbers and zeros with the natural numbers completes the integers. Sometimes we hide the negative as in `below', but there were actually better historical reasons than fear. For example saying a temperature of `5 degrees below zero' resulted from the physical limitations of early weather communication devices and their inability to produce the phrase `\(-5\)'.</p>
