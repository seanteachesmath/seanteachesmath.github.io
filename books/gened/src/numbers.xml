</p>

<p>With natural or counting numbers we can generate an infinite number of
patterns. Some of these patterns come from lists, or sequences, of
numbers. For example, how can we generate <me>1, 2, 3, 4, \dots</me> and what
might come next? I would guess <m>5</m>. What about <me>1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
\dots</me> and what might come next? I would guess <m>8</m>. The first of
these patterns arises by repeated addition of ones, the second is a bit
more complicated - the Fibonacci series. We start with two 1's and the
next number is the sum of the previous two. Mathematically we might
introduce `subscript notation' to track the numbers in an ordered list,
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
F_0 \amp = 1\\
F_1 \amp = 1\\
F_n \amp = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \text{ for } n \ge 2
\end{aligned}</me>
This pattern is used (and perhaps more often abused) throughout the
natural sciences as a source or explanation of biological patterns.</p>

<p>Though more sophisticated approaches can be used to generate Pascal's
triangle (Fig. \ref{fig::pascal}), the first observation is likely that
any number on the interior is the sum of the two entries above it.

<p>''Two wrong a make a right''
A pattern of decreasing numbers multiplied by a factor of <m>-1</m>
illustrates that <m>(-1)\times(-1)</m> is expected to be <m>1</m>. It might
make sense to think of <m>(3)\times(-1)</m> as <m>(-1) + (-1) + (-1)</m>.
Including negative (whole) numbers and zeros with the natural numbers
completes the integers. Sometimes we hide the negative as in `below',
but there were actually better historical reasons than fear. For example
saying a temperature of `5 degrees below zero' resulted from the
physical limitations of early weather communication devices and their
inability to produce the phrase `<m>-5</m>'.

<p>
Multiplication can occur in either order. Multiplication of whole
numbers and whole numbers doesn't change the types of numbers we
encounter as results. We can write repeated addition as multiplication,
but not all multiplication problems make sense as addition problems.</p>

<title> Division </title>
<introduction> <p> ... </p> </introduction>
<p>
Rational numbers are all numbers that can be written as fractions of
whole numbers (integers). These may `terminate' as in <m>\sfrac{1}{4}
= 0.25</m> or repeat forever as single digits <m>\sfrac{1}{3} =
0.333\dots=0.\overline{3}</m> or patterns <m>\sfrac{3}{11} =
0.2727\dots=0.\overline{27}</m>.</p>

<p>A famous claim in mathematics is that <m>1 = 0.999\dots</m>. Below we show
a rather clever calculation that demonstrates this equality from an
algebraic perspective.</p>

<p><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
x \amp = 0.999\dots = 0.\overline{9}\amp\amp\quad \text{define } x\\
{10x} \amp = {9.999\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{multiply by } 10\\
{10x - x} \amp = {9.999\dots - 0.999\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{subtract
original from each side}\\
{9x} \amp = {9}\amp\amp\quad \text{simplify}\\
x \amp = 1\amp\amp\quad \text{isolate } x
\end{aligned}</me></p>

<p>Other verbal arguments might be more satisfying than this. For example,
since we always have to place 9's at the end of <m>0.999\dots</m> there is
no room to fit a number between <m>0.999\dots</m> and <m>1</m>, so they must
be the same.</p>

<title> Fractions and decimals </title>
<introduction> <p>
Fractions with integers on top and bottom are called rational numbers,
or <me>\mathbb{Q} = \left\lbrace\sfrac{m}{n} \text{such that} m, n \in
\mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace\footnote{Writing a fraction in the form
<m>\sfrac{m}{n}</m> means the same as writing it in the form
<m>\frac{m}{n}</m>, the first just looks a bit nicer in sentences.}</me> For
example, <me>\sfrac{2}{5}, \sfrac{3}{7} ,\sfrac{-1}{6},
\sfrac{3}{1}</me> are examples of rational numbers. Yes,
<m>\sfrac{3}{1} = 3</m> which suggests that integers and natural numbers
are special cases of rational numbers with denominators of <m>1</m>.</p>
</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="sub-Decimals-to-fractions">
<title> Decimals to fractions </title>
<introduction> <p> ... </p> </introduction>
<p>
Certain patterns of decimal digits can be represented as rational
numbers or fractions with integers on top and bottom. The strategy of
showing that <m>1=0.999\dots</m> is more generally useful as a technique
for writing certain decimals as ratios of integers (i.e., rational
numbers). Below are a few examples that highlight the awareness required
to pull off the technique carefully.
%
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
x \amp = 0.333\dots = 0.\overline{3} \amp\amp\quad \text{define } x\\
10x \amp = 3.333\dots \amp\amp\quad \text{multiply by } 10\\\
10x - x \amp = 3.333\dots - 0.333\dots \amp\amp\quad \text{subtract original from each side}\\
9x \amp = 3 \amp\amp\quad \text{simplify}\\
x \amp = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \amp\amp\quad \text{isolate } x \text{, 
reduce result}
\end{aligned}</me>
%
With a more complicated pattern of digits, we might get stuck if we
trudge ahead carelessly.
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
x \amp = 0.1212\dots = 0.\overline{12}\amp\amp\quad \text{define } x\\
\cancel{10x} \amp = \cancel{1.212\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{multiply by } 10\\\
\cancel{10x - x} \amp = \cancel{1.212\dots - 0.121\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{subtract original from each side}\\
\cancel{9x} \amp = \cancel{1.0909}\amp\amp\quad \text{give up!}
\end{aligned}</me>
%
Noticing that we are unable to align the decimal parts, a natural
question is whether we could move the decimal one more position. We can
do this with multiplication by 100 rather than by 10.
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
x \amp = 0.1212\dots = 0.\overline{12}\amp\amp\quad \text{define } x\\
{100x} \amp = {12.121\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{multiply by } 100\\\
{100x - x} \amp = {12.121\dots - 0.121\dots}\amp\amp\quad \text{subtract
original from each side}\\
{99x} \amp = {12}\amp\amp\quad \text{simplify}\\
x \amp = \frac{12}{99} = \frac{\cancel{3}\cdot4}{\cancel{3}\cdot33} =
\frac{4}{33}\amp\amp\quad \text{isolate } x \text{, reduce  result}
\end{aligned}</me>

<introduction> 
<p>Review of tax problem</p>

<p>Counting we are used to counting by tens, likely using fingers. But it
turns out there is potentially much more we can do with a set of hands.
The 4 typical fingers on a hand each contain 3 joints which allows us to
count in 3's to 12. Keeping track of those sets of 12's one at a time
using the other hand allows us to count in sets of 12s from 0 to 12 (1
set of 12) to 24 (2 sets of 12), and so on up to 60 (5 sets of 12).</p>

<p>Though the base-60 on two hands technique is quite amazing, we are much

perhaps more mathematically, as 
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
46.72 \amp= 4(10^1) + 6(10^0) + 7(10^{-1})+2(10^{-2})\\
\amp= 4(10) + 6(1) + 7(0.1) + 2(0.01)\\

<subsection xml:id="sub-Application-unit-conversions">
<title> Application of unit conversions </title>
<introduction> <p> ... </p> </introduction>
<p>A common way to reason about numbers is to think of their role in unit
conversions. For example, when measuring distance we have that
<me>12 \text{inches} = 1 \text{foot}.</me> This seems to violate the idea
that two sides of an equation must have an equal unit, but this identity
allows us to convert between lengths or distances measured with
different units. We might be interested in our pace, calculated from
nice numbers, while running a 5k race.</p>

<example xml:id="race-pace">
<title> Race pace </title>
<statement>
<p>
Assume it takes someone 25 minutes to run a 5k (km) race. What is the
pace in minutes per mile?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
We have 25 minutes per 5 km or
<me>\dfrac{25 \text{minutes}}{5 \text{km}}</me> At this point it will be
helpful to know or remember that <m>1 \text{mile} = 1.609 \text{km}</m>.
Combining this we have <me>\dfrac{25 \text{minutes}}{5 \text{km}} =
\dfrac{25 \text{minutes}}{5 \cancel{\text{km}}}\times\dfrac{1.609 \
cancel{\text{km}}}{1 \text{mile}}</me> Multiplying across numerators and
denominators, this gives <me>\dfrac{25 \text{minutes}}{5 \text{km}} =
\dfrac{25 \text{minutes}}{5 \cancel{\text{km}}}\times\dfrac{1.609 \
cancel{\text{km}}}{1 \text{mile}} =
\dfrac{8.045 \text{minutes}}{1 \text{mile}}</me> This corresponds to 8.045
minutes per mile, but taking this one step further, we can notice that
<m>0.045 \text{minutes}</m> is the extra fractional part of a minute it
takes us. Converting this to seconds we have
<me>\dfrac{0.045 \cancel{\text{minutes}}}{1}\times\dfrac{60 \text{seconds}
}{1 \cancel{\text{minute}}} = 2.7 \text{seconds}</me> Thus, we could
equivalently take our pace as
<me>8\!:\!03 \dfrac{\text{minutes}}{\text{mile}}</me>
Again it is important to remember that `per' means `divided by' so that
minutes per mile is an amount of minutes divided by (a convenient
amount, usually one of) miles.
</solution>

</example>

<p>One could very quickly ask about speed. We could calculate the
reciprocal
<me>\left(\dfrac{8.045 \text{minutes}}{1 \text{mile}}\right)^{-1} =
\dfrac{1 \text{mile}}{8.045 \text{minutes}}</me> which gives
<m>0.124 \dfrac{\text{miles}}{\text{minute}}</m> or (since there are
<m>60 \text{minutes per hour}</m>) a speed of <m>7.458 \text{miles per
hour}</m>!</p>

<p>Additionally we can combine information with different units to solve a
variety of interesting problems. Consider what use we could make of
information on our car's fuel economy (e.g., miles per gallon) and our
fuel costs (e.g., dollars per gallon). 
<me>\dfrac{36 \text{miles}}{1 \cancel{\text{gallon}}}\times\dfrac{1 \
cancel{\text{gallon}}}{\$4} = \dfrac{9 \text{miles}}{\$1}</me> This means
that in fuel costs alone we could expect to drive 9 miles for every
dollar we spend on fuel. The idea of a reciprocal provides some
additional information here as well,
<me>\left(\dfrac{9 \text{miles}}{\$1}\right)^{-1} =
\underbrace{\dfrac{\$1}{9 \text{miles}} =
\dfrac{\$\sfrac{1}{9}}{\text{mile}}}_{\text{dollars per mile}}</me> In
this case it costs us about <m>\$0.11 \text{per mile}</m></p>

<introduction> <p> ... </p> </introduction>

<p>Powers of 2, binary numbers
Since the digits in base-10 are zero through nine (but no ten), we might
assume that the digits in base-2 are zero and one. Here we think of
numbers as being built from positive and negative powers of 2. Positive
powers give us whole numbers and negative powers contribute fractional
parts. With a bit more subtlety this underlies the entirety of our
digital representation of numbers.</p>

<p>To write a number such as <m>5</m>, we think of what powers of two add to
the number <m>5</m>, here
<me>5 = 4 + 1 = 1\times2^2 + 0\times2^1 + 1\times2^0</me> Writing this in
binary we have <me>\left(5\right)_{\text{ten}} = \left(101\right)_2</me>
where the subscripted number tells the base. We can also use a decimal
to write the fractional part in terms of powers of one-half (or negative
powers of two). For example, <m>\sfrac{5}{8}</m> in terms of base-2 is 
<me>\begin{aligned}[t]
\dfrac{5}{8} \amp= 1\times\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right) +
0\times\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)+ 1\times\left(\dfrac{1}{8}\right)\\
\amp = 1\times\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right) +
0\times\left(\dfrac{1}{2^2}\right)+ 1\times\left(\dfrac{1}{2^3}\right)\\
\amp = 1\times2^{-1} + 0\times2^{-2}+ 1\times2^{-3}\\
\amp = (0.101)_{2}
\end{aligned}</me>
Putting this all together we can write <m>5.625</m> (or `five and
five-eighths') as the binary number <me>(101.101)_2</me></p>

<exercise xml:id="chall-to-base-2">
<p>
Earlier we interpreted the number <m>46.72</m> as base-10. What is this
number in base 2? Is this easily done?
