 <title>Multivariate Probability Distributions and Densities</title>

 <introduction>
 <p>
We will study the theory of multivariable discrete and continuous random
variables, their mathematical expectations, and specific examples of
densities from practice. We will largely
repeat the ideas of <xref ref="chap-discrete"/> and <xref ref="chap-cont"/>, but 
this time in higher dimensions.
