 <title>Continuous Random Variables</title>

 <introduction>
 <p>
We will study the theory of single-variable continuous random
variables, their mathematical expectations, and specific examples of
densities from practice.  Following that we will briefly look at the
theory of multivariable continuous random variables. We will largely
repeat the ideas of <xref ref="chap-discrete"/>, but this time for
continuous random variables.  Terminology will be introduced, but the
ideas are the same, only now the process of summation is replaced by
integration.
