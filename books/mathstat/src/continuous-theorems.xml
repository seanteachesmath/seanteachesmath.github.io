 <introduction>
<!--> <p>We will learn and practice direct methods for computing derivatives
of functions defined by products or quotients of terms.</p>

 <p>The theory of groups occupies a central position in mathematics.
Modern group theory arose from an attempt to find the roots of a
polynomial in terms of its coefficients. Groups now play a central role
in such areas as coding theory, counting, and the study of symmetries;
many areas of biology, chemistry, and physics have benefited from group
theory.</p>-->
