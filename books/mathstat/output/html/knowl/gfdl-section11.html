<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-gfdl.html#gfdl-section11">in-context</a></span>
