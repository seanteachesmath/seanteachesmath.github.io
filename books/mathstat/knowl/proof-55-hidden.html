<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>First suppose that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\)  We must show that the three conditions hold.  Since \(H\) is a group, it must have an identity \(e_H\text{.}\)  We must show that \(e_H = e\text{,}\) where \(e\) is the identity of \(G\text{.}\) We know that \(e_H e_H = e_H\) and that \(ee_H = e_H e = e_H\text{;}\) hence, \(ee_H = e_H e_H\text{.}\)  By right-hand cancellation, \(e =e_H\text{.}\)  The second condition holds since a subgroup \(H\) is a group.  To prove the third condition, let \(h \in H\text{.}\)  Since \(H\) is a group, there is  an element \(h' \in H\) such that \(hh' = h'h = e\text{.}\)  By the uniqueness  of the inverse in \(G\text{,}\) \(h' = h^{-1}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Conversely, if the three conditions hold, we must show that \(H\) is a group under the same operation as \(G\text{;}\) however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are exactly the axioms stated in the definition of a group.</p></article></body>
