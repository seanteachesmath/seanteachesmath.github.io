<p>A <dfn class="terminology">symmetry</dfn> of a geometric figure is a rearrangement of the figure preserving the arrangement of its sides and vertices as well as its distances and angles.  A map from the plane to itself preserving the symmetry of an object is called a <dfn class="terminology">rigid motion</dfn>.  For example, if we look at the rectangle in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-groups-rectangle.html" title="Figure 2.1.5">Figure 2.1.5</a>, it is easy to see that a rotation of \(180^{\circ}\) or \(360^{\circ}\) returns a rectangle in the plane with the same orientation as the original rectangle and the same relationship among the vertices.  A reflection of the rectangle across either the vertical axis or the horizontal axis can also be seen to be a symmetry.  However, a \(90^{\circ}\) rotation in either direction cannot be a symmetry unless the rectangle is a square.</p>
