  <introduction>
    <p>Perception of sound is our reaction to changes in air pressure. Sound waves can be analysed by decomposing the wave into different parts. Each part gives the contribution of a certain frequency of the sound. Using software, we can view the components of a sound using a spectrogram.  The information below should give you a chance to both hear and see sounds.  The ability to "look at" sounds has important practical implications.</p>

  <!-- Sections can be written directly here, but it might help  -->
  <!-- with organization to include them as separate files.      -->
