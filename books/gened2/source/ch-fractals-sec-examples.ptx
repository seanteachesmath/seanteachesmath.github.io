  <title>Examples of fractals</title>
  <introduction>
  
<p>There are an endless number of interesting fractals and in many cases
a variety of mechanisms of generating a particular fractal.</p>

    <title>Typical construction</title>
<p> The Sierpinski triangle can be constructed by shading an inverted
triangle in the middle of each white triangle.</p>

	<caption>Top left: Step 0 is an upright white triangle. Top right: Step 1 contains an
	inverted, shaded triangle in the center of what was 'Step 0'. Bottom left: Step 2
	contains all of the triangles present in 'Step 1', but adds three
	shaded, inverted triangles in the white space of 'Step 1'.  Bottom Right: Step 3 (and
	onward) is more of the same.</caption>

Hopefully something about the construction strikes you as interesting.
If so, what do you notice? If not, what might make this more interesting
to you, personally? Connections to a specific application?

<p><title>How many triangles?</title>
Count the numbers of each kind of triangle (black and white) at each
step.  Does it change predictably? Organizing your results with a table
might help.

<title>Calculating Numbers of Triangles</title>
<introduction><p>With a bit of careful guessing, it's possible to
explore formulas that support these patterns and that allow us to
predict what happens as the number of steps increases (beyond our
drawing ability).</p></introduction>

<p>How can we relate the numbers of
each type of triangle and the total to the step number? Looking at the
white triangle numbers, you might notice that the number increases by a
factor of three each step.  In fact, if we let <m>W_{k}</m> be
the number of white triangles on step <m>k</m>, <me>W_{k}=3^{k}</me>. 
If we went to Step 10, we would expect <m>W_{10} =
3^10</m>, which is <m>59,049</m> white triangles!</p>

<p>Now, at each step, we add as many new black triangles as we
previously had white triangles.  A black triangle, once added
is never tampered with again.  To work out a formula, let's speculate on
how many black triangles we would encounter in Step 4.  We enter the step with the triangles illustrated in Step 3, but each
