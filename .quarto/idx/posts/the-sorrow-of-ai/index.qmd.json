To power a new data center, Microsoft made a deal to open the nuclear power plant just a few miles from where I grew up that, just a few years before I was born, experienced a partial meltdown.

The graphing calculator, a story in itself, has neither improved, nor gone down in price, since then.  The story is \"we didn't have enough money to buy one while I was in high school, or I was too afraid to ask money questions at home, so I borrowed one from the school (during the school day only)\". Later and in preparation for college, as a high school graduation present, I was given a translucent Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus, in silver.\n\nAs often is the case with many college students, I wasn't really allowed to use it for much in class anyway.  Today, it pretty much sits in my desk drawer unused, and as long as the batteries work (just 4 AAA or AA batteries), it's free to borrow at any time. Now *teaching* college math, rather than *taking* it, I am always disappointed to see students expected or expecting to use graphing calculators, what terrible devices.\n\nBack to the main point. Our obsession with tools.  Graphing calculators aren't inherently terrible, they are just currently overpriced and somewhat inflexible.  Now there are a variety of freely-available graphical (e.g., <https://desmos.org>) or computational (e.g., <https://cocalc.org>) tools for use on phones, tablets, and laptops.  \n\nIronically, we have often limited our, and our students', available tools to decades-old technology. Suddenly, we have gone from a lifetime of use on a watch battery and solar cell, to something on the order of a half a liter of water for every 100 words of email.\n\nWe are plagued by the pursuit of innovation, when sometimes we should just stick to [\"stuff that works\"](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mprD2MN5vo>). Does AI have a place in higher education, sure? I just don't want to hear about it every single day.\n\nThinking of \"stuff that works\", good solid fundamentals, made me think of this table^[Recreated from: _Are Biologists Getting the Mathematical Training They Need in College?_ \nJill A. Marshall and Pablo Durán.
