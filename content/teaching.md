# Courses taught (_or developed_)
* MATH 1113 Mathematics for General Education
* _MATH 2153 Bio-Calculus_ - This class uses custom materials that have
substantially devolved from the inspiring textbook Modeling the Dynamics
of Life by Fred Adler, developed jointly with Brittany Bannish.
* MATH 2313 Calculus I
* _MATH 2753 Technology for Professional Mathematics and Statistics_ -
This class uses custom materials that have been developed to introduce
software for mathematical typesetting, introductory numerical computing,
and introductory symbolic manipulation.
* MATH 3103 Differential Equations
* _MATH 49/5910 Introduction to Biological Dynamics_
* _MATH 4263/5373 Applied Numerical Analysis_ - This class is built around
the oldest possible edition of the great book Numerical Analysis
by Burden and Faires. I mix things up by doing interesting things
with the order of topics and bringing in more modern, but still
accessible, research papers and reviews.
* _MATH 49/5910 Industrial Applications_
* STAT 4113 Mathematical Statistics I - I get to teach a class using my
own copy of Freundâ€™s Mathematical Statistics (from when I took the class
myself)!
