<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">Types of Questions:</em></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Questions outlined by a blue box make up the “RQS” <em class="emphasis">representative question set</em>. This set of questions is intended to cover the most essential ideas in each section. These questions are usually highly typical of what you'd see on an exam, although some of them are atypical but carry an important moral. If you find yourself unconfident with the idea behind one of these, it's probably a good idea to practice similar questions.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This representative question set is our suggestion for a minimal selection of questions to work on.  You are highly encouraged to work on more.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In addition to original problems, this book contains problems pulled from quizzes and exams given at UBC for Math 100 and 180 (first-semester calculus) and Math 120 (honours first-semester calculus). These problems are marked by “(*)”. The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of the many people who collaborated to produce these exams over the years.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Finally, the questions are organized into three types: <em class="alert">Stage 1</em>, <em class="alert">Stage 2</em> and <em class="alert">Stage 3</em>.</p>
<ul class="circle">

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The first category is meant to test and improve your understanding of basic underlying concepts. These often do not involve much calculation. They range in difficulty from very basic reviews of definitions to questions that require you to be thoughtful about the concepts covered in the section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Questions in this category are for practicing skills. It's not enough to understand the philosophical grounding of an idea: you have to be able to apply it in appropriate situations. This takes practice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The last questions in each section go a little farther than “<em class="alert"></em>”. Often they will combine more than one idea, incorporate review material, or ask you to apply your understanding of a concept to a new situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In exams, as in life, you will encounter questions of varying difficulty. A good skill to practice is recognizing the level of difficulty a problem poses. Exams will have some easy questions, some standard questions, and some harder questions.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="part-differential.html#li-5">in-context</a></span>
