<p>Note what happens to \(f(x)\) as \(x\) increases from strongly negative values to strongly positive values.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When \(x\) is large and negative, \(f(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) decreases continuously until \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) where \(f(x) \lt 0\text{.}\) In particular, since \(f(-1)=\frac{65}{16} \gt 0\) and \(f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0\)  and \(f(x)\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that \(f(x)\) takes the value zero for some \(x\) between \(-\frac{1}{2}\) and \(-1\text{.}\) More descriptively put, as \(x\) increases from hugely negative numbers to \(-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) passes  through zero exactly once.</li>
<li>As \(x\) increases beyond  \(-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) increases continuously, starting negative and becoming very large and positive when \(x\) becomes large and positive. In particular, since \(f(0)=\frac{1}{16} \gt 0\) and \(f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0\)  and \(f(x)\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that \(f(x)\) takes the value zero for some \(x\) between \(-\frac{1}{2}\) and \(0\text{.}\) So, as \(x\) increases from \(-\frac{1}{2}\) to near \(+\infty\text{,}\) \(f(x)\)  again passes through zero exactly once.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So \(f(x)\) must have exactly two roots, one with \(x \lt -\frac{1}{2}\) and one with \(x \gt -\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</p>
