<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(a) Since the perimeter of the cross section of the bottle does not change, \(p\) (the perimeter of the ellipse) is the same as the perimeter of the circle of radius 5.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(b) The volume of the bottle will be the area of its cross section times its height. This is always the case when you have some two-dimensional shape, and turn it into a three-dimensional object by “pulling” the shape straight up. (For example, you can think of a cylinder as a circle that has been “pulled” straight up. To understand why this formula works, think about what is means to measure the area of a shape in square centimetres, and the volume of an object in cubic centimetres.)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(c) You can use what you know about \(a\) and the formula from (a) to find \(b\) and \(\ds\diff{b}{t}\text{.}\) Then use the formula from \((b)\text{.}\)</p>
