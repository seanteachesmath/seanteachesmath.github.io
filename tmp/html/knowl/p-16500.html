<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(c)\(\implies\)(a): We are to show that \(\vF\) is conservative. We'll start by guessing \(\varphi\) and then we'll verify that, for our chosen \(\varphi\text{,}\) we really do have \(\vF=\vnabla\varphi\text{.}\) Our guess for \(\varphi\) is motivated by Theorem <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_workIntegral.html" title="Theorem 13.4.2">13.4.2</a>. If our \(\vF\) really is conservative, its potential is going to have to obey \(\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} =\varphi(P_1) - \varphi(P_0)\) for any curve \(\cC\) that starts at \(P_0\) and ends at \(P_1\text{.}\) Let's choose \(P_0=\vZero\text{.}\) Remembering, from Definition <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_conservative.html" title="Definition 13.3.1">13.3.1</a>.a, that adding a constant to a potential always yields another potential, we can always choose \(\varphi(\vZero)=0\text{.}\) Then \(\varphi(P_1)=\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\) for any curve \(\cC\) that starts at \(\vZero\) and ends at \(P_1\text{.}\) So define, for each point \(\vx\text{,}\) \(\varphi(\vx)=\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\) for any curve \(\cC\) that starts at \(\vZero\) and ends at \(\vx\text{.}\) Note that, since we we are assuming that (c) is true, the integral \(\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\) takes the same value for all curves \(\cC\) that start at \(\vZero\) and end at \(\vx\text{.}\)</p>
