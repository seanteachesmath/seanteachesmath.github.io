<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, note that the distance travelled by the plane is equal to the area under the curve of its speed.</p>
<p>We need to know the speed of the plane at the midpoints of our intervals. So (for example) noon to 1pm <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">is not</em> one of your intervals--we don't know the speed at 12:30. (A common idea is to average the two end values, 700 and 800. This is a fine approximation, but it is not a Riemann sum.) So, we use the two intervals 12:00 to 2:00, and 2:00 to 4:00. Then our intervals have length 2 hours, and at the midpoints of the intervals the speed of the plane is 700 kph and 900 kph, respectively. So, our midpoint Riemann sum gives us:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
700(2)+900(2) = 3200
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">an approximation of 3200 km travelled by the plane from noon to 4:00 pm.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remark: if we had been asked to approximate the distance travelled from 11:30 am to 4:30 pm, then we could have used the midpoint rule with five intervals and made use of every entry in the data table. With the question as stated, however, we ignore three out of five entries in the table because they are not the midpoints of our intervals.</p>
