<p>Let \(T(x,y,z,t)\) be the temperature at time \(t\) at the point \((x,y,z)\) in some object \(\cB\text{.}\) The heat equation<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-662-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.2.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> is the partial differential equation that describes the flow of heat energy and consequently the behaviour of \(T\text{.}\) We now use the divergence theorem to derive the heat equation from two physical “laws”, that we assume are valid:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of an object by \(\De T\) degrees is \(CM\,\De T\) where, \(M\) is the mass of the object and \(C\) is a positive physical constant determined by the material contained in the object. It is called the specific heat, or specific heat capacity<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-663-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.2.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a>, of the object.</li>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Think of heat energy as a moving fluid. We will rig its velocity field so that heat flows in the direction opposite to the temperature gradient. Precisely, we choose its velocity field to be \(-\ka\vnabla T(x,y,z,t)\text{.}\) Here \(\ka\) is another positive physical constant called the thermal conductivity of the object. So the rate at which heat is conducted across an element of surface area \(\dee{S}\) at \((x,y,z)\) in the direction of its unit normal \(\hn\) is given by \(-\ka\hn\cdot\vnabla T(x,y,z,t)\,\dee{S}\) at time \(t\text{.}\) (See Lemma <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem_fluxInterp.html" title="Lemma 14.4.1">14.4.1</a>.) For example, in the figure</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:37.5%;margin-right:37.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="figs/heat1.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">the temperature gradient, which points in the direction of increasing temperature, is opposite \(\hn\text{.}\) Consequently the flow rate \(-\ka\hn\cdot\vnabla T(x,y,z,t)\,\dee{S}\) is positive, indicating flow in the direction of \(\hn\text{.}\) This is just what you would expect — heat flows from hot regions to cold regions. Also the rate of flow increases as the magnitude of the temperature gradient increases. This also makes sense (and is reminiscent of Newton's law of cooling).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Let \(V\subset\cB\) be <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">any</em> three dimensional region in the object and denote by \(\partial V\) the surface of \(V\) and by \(\hn\) the outward normal to \(\partial V\text{.}\) The amount of heat that <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">enters</em> \(V\) across an infinitesimal piece \(\dee{S}\) of \(\partial V\) in an infinitesimal time interval \(\dee{t}\) is \(-\big(-\ka\hn\cdot\vnabla T(x,y,z,t)\,\dee{S}\big)\,\dee{t}\text{.}\) The amount of heat that enters \(V\) across all of \(\partial V\) in the time interval \(\dee{t}\) is given by the integral</p>
