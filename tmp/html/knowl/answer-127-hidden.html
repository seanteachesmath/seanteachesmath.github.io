<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This isn't the kind of equality that we can just solve; we'll need a trick, and that trick is the IVT. The general idea is to show that \(\sin x\) is somewhere bigger, and somewhere smaller, than \(x-1\text{.}\) However, since the IVT can only show us that a function is equal to a constant, we need to slightly adjust our language. Showing \(\sin x = x-1\) is equivalent to showing \(\sin x - x + 1 = 0\text{,}\) so let \(f(x)=\sin x - x +1\text{,}\) and let's show that it has a real root.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, we need to note that \(f(x)\) is continuous (otherwise we can't use the IVT). Now, we need to find a value of \(x\) for which it is positive, and for which it's negative. By checking a few values, we find \(f(0)\) is positive, and \(f(100)\) is negative.  So, by the IVT, there exists a value of \(x\) (between \(0\) and \(100\)) for which \(f(x)=0\text{.}\) Therefore, there exists a value of \(x\) for which \(\sin x = x-1\text{.}\)</p>
