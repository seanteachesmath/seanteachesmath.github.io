<p>Since the Frenet-Serret formulae constitute a first order system of ordinary differential equations for the vector \((\hat\vT(s)\,,\,\hat\vN(s)\,,\,\hat\vB(s))\) and since any first order linear initial value problem has a exactly one solution,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the vector valued function \((\hat\vT(s)\,,\,\hat\vN(s)\,,\,\hat\vB(s))\) is determined by the functions \(\ka(s)\) and \(\tau(s)\) (assuming that they are continuous) together with the initial condition \((\hat\vT(0)\,,\,\hat\vN(0)\,,\,\hat\vB(0))\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Furthermore, once you know \(\hat\vT(s)\text{,}\) then \(\vr(s)\) is determined by \(\vr(0)\) and \(\diff{\vr}{s}(s)=\hat\vT(s)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>So any smooth curve \(\vr(s)\) is completely determined by \(\vr(0)\text{,}\) \((\hat\vT(0)\,,\,\hat\vN(0)\,,\,\hat\vB(0))\text{,}\) \(\ka(s)\) and \(\tau(s)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>That is, up to translations (you can move between any two possible choices of \(\vr(0)\) by  a translation) and rotations (you can move between any two possible choices of \((\hat\vT(0)\,,\,\hat\vN(0)\,,\,\hat\vB(0))\) by  a rotation) a curve is       completely determined by the curvature \(\ka(s) \gt 0\) and the torsion \(\tau(s)\text{.}\) This result is called “The fundamental theorem of space curves”.</li>
