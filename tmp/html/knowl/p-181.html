<p>It is not immediately obvious how we can use the second method, since we only  have one point on the curve, namely \((1,1)\text{.}\) However we can use it to “sneak  up” on the answer.  Let's approximate the tangent line, by drawing a line that  passes through \((1,1)\) and some nearby point — call it \(Q\text{.}\) Here is our recipe:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We are given the point \(P=(1,1)\) and we are told</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Find the tangent line to the curve \(y=x^2\) that passes through \(P = (1,1)\text{.}\)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We don't quite know how to find a line given just 1 point, however we do  know how to find a line passing through 2 points. So pick another point on the  curves whose coordinates are very close to \(P\text{.}\) Now rather than picking some  actual numbers, I am going to write our second point as \(Q = (1+h, (1+h)^2)\text{.}\)  That is, a point \(Q\) whose \(x\)-coordinate is equal to that of \(P\) plus a little  bit — where the little bit is some small number \(h\text{.}\)  And since this point  lies on the curve \(y=x^2\text{,}\) and \(Q\)'s x-coordinate is \(1+h\text{,}\) \(Q\)'s y-coordinate must  be \((1+h)^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If having \(h\) as an variable rather than a number bothers you, start by  thinking of \(h\) as \(0.1\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>A picture of the situation will help.</li>
