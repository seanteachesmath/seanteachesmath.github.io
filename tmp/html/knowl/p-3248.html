<p>Here \(k\) is a constant of proportionality that is determined by the half–life. We shall explain what half-life is and also determine  the value of \(k\) in Example <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_carbonDatingHalfLife.html" title="Example 4.3.3: Carbon dating and half–life">4.3.3</a>, below. Before we do so, let's  think about the sign in equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 4.3.1: Radioactive decay">4.3.1</a>.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Recall that \(Q(t)\) denotes  a quantity, namely the amount of \({}^{14}C\) present at  time \(t\text{.}\) There cannot be a negative amount of \({}^{14}C\text{,}\) nor can this quantity be zero (otherwise we wouldn't use carbon dating, so we must have \(Q(t) \gt  0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>As the time \(t\) increases, \(Q(t)\) decreases, because \({}^{14}C\) is being  continuously converted into \({}^{14}N\) by radioactive decay <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-119-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. Thus \(\diff{Q}{t}(t) \lt  0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The signs \(Q(t) \gt  0\) and \(\diff{Q}{t}(t) \lt  0\) are consistent with equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 4.3.1: Radioactive decay">4.3.1</a> provided the constant of  proportionality \(k \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>In equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 4.3.1: Radioactive decay">4.3.1</a>, we chose to call the constant of  proportionality  “\(-k\)”. We did so in order to make \(k \gt 0\text{.}\) We could just as well have chosen to  call the constant of proportionality “\(K\)”.  That is, we could have replaced  equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 4.3.1: Radioactive decay">4.3.1</a> by \(\diff{Q}{t}(t)=K Q(t)\text{.}\) The constant of proportionality \(K\) would have to be negative, (and \(K\) and \(k\) would be related by  \(K=-k\)).</li>
