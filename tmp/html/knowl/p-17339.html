<p>Consider the sphere \(x^2+y^2+z^2=1\text{.}\) We can think of this surface as having two sides â€” an inside (the side you see when you are living inside the sphere) and an outside (the side you see when you are living outside the sphere). Concentrate on one point \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\) on the sphere. The surface \(x^2+y^2+z^2=1\) has precisely two unit normal vectors at \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\text{,}\) namely</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\hn_+ =  +(x_0,y_0,z_0)\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\hn_- = -(x_0,y_0,z_0)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We can view \(\hn_+\) as being associated to (or attached to) the outside of the sphere and \(\hn_-\) as being associated to (or attached to) the inside of the sphere. Note that, as we move over the sphere, both \(\hn_+\) and \(\hn_-\) change continuously.</p>
