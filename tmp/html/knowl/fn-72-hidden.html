<body><div class="fn">Unfortunately there is another Euler's constant, \(\gamma\text{,}\)  which is more properly called the  Euler–Mascheroni constant. Anyway like many  mathematical discoveries, \(e\) was first found by someone else — Napier used the  constant \(e\) in order to compute logarithms but only implicitly. Bernoulli was probably  the first to approximate it when examining continuous compound interest. It first  appeared explicitly in work of Leibniz, though he denoted it \(b\text{.}\) It was Euler, though,  who established the notation we now use and who showed how important the constant is to  mathematics.</div></body>
