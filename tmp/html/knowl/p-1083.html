<p>Let us go back to the definition and look at each of these pieces in turn.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Setting things up — The first sentence of the definition is really  just setting up the picture. It is telling us what the definition is about and  sorting out a few technical details.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">Let \(a \in \mathbb{R}\)</em> — This simply tells us that the symbol  “\(a\)” is a real number <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-51-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.7.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">Let \(f(x)\) be a function</em> — This is just setting the scene so  that we understand all of the terms and symbols.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">defined everywhere in a neighbourhood of \(a\text{,}\) except possibly at  \(a\)</em> — This is just a technical requirement; we need our function to be  defined in a little region <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-52-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.7.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> around \(a\text{.}\) The  function doesn't have to be defined everywhere, but it must be defined for all  \(x\)-values a little less than \(a\) and a little more than \(a\text{.}\) The definition  does not care about what the function does outside this little window, nor does  it care what happens exactly at \(a\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names, phrases and notation — The next part of the definition is simply  naming the property we are discussing and tells us how to write it down. i.e. we  are talking about “limits” and we write them down using the symbols  indicated.</li>
<li>
<p>The heart of things — we explain this at length below, but for now we  will give a quick explanation. <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">Work on these two points. They are hard.</em></p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">for all \(\epsilon \gt 0\) there exists \(\delta  \gt 0\)</em> — It is  important we read this in order. It means that we can pick any positive number  \(\epsilon\) we want and there will always be another positive number \(\delta\)  that is going to make what ever follows be true.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">if \(0 \lt |x-a| \lt \delta\) then \(|f(x)-L| \lt \epsilon\)</em> — From the  previous point we have our two numbers — any \(\epsilon  \gt 0\) then based on that  choice of \(\epsilon\) we have a positive number \(\delta\text{.}\) The current statement  says that whenever we have chosen \(x\) so that it is very close to \(a\text{,}\) then  \(f(x)\) has to be very close to \(L\text{.}\) How close it “very close”? Well  \(0 \lt |x-a| \lt \delta\) means that \(x\) has to be within a distance \(\delta\) of \(a\)  (but not exactly \(a\)) and similarly \(|f(x)-L| \lt \epsilon\) means that \(f(x)\) has  to  be within a distance \(\epsilon\) of \(L\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">That is the definition broken up into pieces which hopefully now make more  sense, but what does it actually <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">mean</em>? Consider a function we saw earlier</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= \begin{cases}
2x &amp; x\neq3\\
9 &amp; x=3
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">and sketch it again:</p>
