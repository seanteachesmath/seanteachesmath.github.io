<p>Now before we get to answering this question, we should first be a little more  precise. The wording of this question is pretty sloppy for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>What we do mean by  “after 1 second”? We know the ball  will move faster and faster as time passes, so after 1 second it does not fall  at one fixed speed.</li>
<li>As it stands a reasonable answer to the question would be just “really  fast”. If the person asking the question wants a numerical answer it  would be better to ask “At what speed” or “With what velocity”.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">We should also be careful using the words “speed” and “velocity” — they  are not interchangeable.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Speed means the distance travelled per unit time and is always a  non-negative number. An unmoving object has speed \(0\text{,}\) while a moving object has  positive speed.</li>
<li>Velocity, on the other hand, also specifies the direction of motion.  In this text we will almost exclusively deal with objects moving along  straight lines. Because of this velocities will be positive or negative  numbers indicating  which direction the object is moving along the line. We  will be more precise about this later <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
