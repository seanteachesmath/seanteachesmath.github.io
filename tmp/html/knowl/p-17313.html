<p>We defined, in ยง<a href="sec_surfaceIntegrals.html" class="internal" title="Section 14.3: Surface Integrals">14.3</a>, two types of integrals over surfaces. We have seen, in ยง<a href="sec_surfaceIntegrals.html#sec_rhodSexamples" class="internal" title="Subsection 14.3.4: Examples of \(\dblInt_S \rho\,\dee{S}\)">14.3.4</a>, some applications that lead to integrals of the type \(\dblInt_S \rho\,\dee{S}\text{.}\) We now look at one application that leads to integrals of the type \(\dblInt_S \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}\text{.}\) Recall that integrals of this type are called flux integrals. Imagine a fluid with</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the density of the fluid (say in kilograms per cubic meter) at position \((x,y,z)\) and time \(t\) being \(\rho(x,y,z,t)\) and with</li>
<li>the velocity of the fluid  (say in meters per second) at position \((x,y,z)\) and time \(t\) being \(\vv(x,y,z,t)\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">We are going to determine the rate (say in kilograms per second) at which the fluid is flowing through a tiny piece \(\dee{S}\) of surface at \((x,y,z)\text{.}\) During a tiny time interval of length \(\dee{t}\) about time \(t\text{,}\) fluid near \(\dee{S}\) moves \(\vv(x,y,z,t)\dee{t}\text{.}\) The green line in the figure below is a side view of \(\dee{S}\) and \(\hn=\hn(x,y,z)\) is a unit normal vector to \(\dee{S}\text{.}\)</p>
