<li>\(\vnabla\cdot(\va \times\vr) = 0\text{,}\) where \(\va\) is a constant vector in \(\bbbr^3\) , and \(\vr\) is the vector field \(\vr= (x, y, z)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>\(\vnabla\times(\vnabla f) = 0\) for all scalar fields \(f\) on \(\bbbr^3\) with continuous second partial derivatives.</li>
<li>\(\vnabla\cdot(f \vF) = \vnabla(f)\cdot \vF + f \vnabla\cdot\vF\text{,}\) for every vector field \(\vF\) in \(\bbbr^3\) with continuous partial derivatives, and every scalar function \(f\) in \(\bbbr^3\) with continuous partial derivatives.</li>
<li>Suppose \(\vF\) is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives in the region \(D\text{,}\) where \(D\) is \(\bbbr^3\) without the origin. If \(\vnabla\cdot\vF   \gt  0\) throughout \(D\text{,}\) then the flux of \(F\) through the sphere of radius \(5\) with center at the origin is positive.</li>
<li>If a vector field \(\vF\) is defined and has continuous partial derivatives everywhere in \(\bbbr^3\text{,}\) and it satisfies \(\vnabla\cdot\vF = 0\text{,}\) everywhere, then, for every sphere, the flux out of one hemisphere is equal to the flux into the opposite hemisphere.</li>
<li>If \(\vr(t)\) is a twice continuously differentiable path in \(\bbbr^2\) with constant curvature \(\kappa\text{,}\) then \(\vr(t)\) parametrizes part of a circle of radius \(1/\kappa\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The vector field \(\vF = \left( -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\,,\,\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\right)\) is conservative in its domain, which is \(\bbbr^2\text{,}\) without the origin.</li>
<li>If a vector field \(\vF = (P, Q)\) in \(\bbbr^2\) has \(Q = 0\) everywhere in \(\bbbr^2\text{,}\) then the line integral \(\oint\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\) is zero, for every simple closed curve in \(\bbbr^2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If the acceleration and the speed of a moving particle in \(\bbbr^3\) are constant, then the motion is taking place along a spiral.</li>
