<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(a) If we were to set this figure on a pencil lined up along the vertical line \(x=a\text{,}\) it seems pretty clear that it would fall to the left. So, the centre of mass is to the left of the line \(x=a\text{.}\) The same is true in (b): the added density on the left makes it only more lopsided. However, in (c), the right point is denser than the left, which could counterbalance the left. Without knowing more about the dimensions and the density, we can't say where the centre of gravity is in relation to the line \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(d) Consider a section of the figure along the interval \([b,c]\text{,}\) and its “mirror” section on the other side of the line \(x=a\text{.}\) These two sections will have the same area, at the same distance from \(x=a\text{.}\) Since we only care about the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of gravity, it doesn't matter that the two halves are at different \(y\)-coordinates. The centroid falls along the line \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(e) There is the same amount of area to the left and right of the line \(x=a\text{,}\) as in part (d). However, the area to the right is “stretched out” more, so that  it occupies space <em class="emphasis">farther away</em> from the line \(x=a\text{.}\) So, the centre of mass will be to the right of the line \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>
