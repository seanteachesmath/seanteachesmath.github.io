<p>If the function were changed to \(\ds \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2-5x+6}\) much of the same  reasoning can be used. Being a little terse we could answer with:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Numerator and denominator are continuous.</li>
<li>Since \(x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)\) the denominator is zero when \(x=2,3\text{.}\)</li>
<li>So the function is continuous everywhere except possibly  at \(x=2,3\text{.}\) In order to verify that the function really is discontinuous at  those points, it suffices to verify that the numerator is non-zero at \(x=2,3\text{.}\)  Indeed we know that \(\sin(x)\) is zero only when \(x = n\pi\) (for any integer  \(n\)). Hence \(\sin(2),\sin(3) \neq 0\text{.}\) Thus the numerator is non-zero, while the  denominator is zero and hence \(x=2,3\) really are points of discontinuity.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Note that this example raises a subtle point about checking continuity when  numerator and denominator are <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">simultaneously</em> zero. There are quite a  few possible outcomes in this case and we need more sophisticated tools to  adequately analyse the behaviour of functions near such points. We will return  to this question later in the text after we have developed Taylor expansions (see  SectionÂ <a href="sec_DIFFTaylor.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.4: Taylor Polynomials">4.4</a>).</p>
