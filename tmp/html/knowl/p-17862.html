<p>(b) Let's first do some strategizing. We have to compute a flux integral over a surface that is not closed. There are two potential sneaky attacks that come to mind.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The first uses Stokes' theorem. But the flux integral in Stokes' theorem  is of the form \(\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vA\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}\text{.}\) So to be able to apply Stokes' theorem in the current problem, \(\vF\) has to be of the form \(\vnabla\times\vA\text{.}\) That is, \(\vF\) has to have a vector potential. We know that in order for \(\vF\) to have a vector potential, it must pass the screening test \(\vnabla\cdot\vF=0\text{.}\) Our \(\vF=z\,\hk\) fails this screening test. So we can't use Stokes' theorem.</li>
<li>The second uses the divergence theorem. But the flux integral in the divergence theorem is over the boundary of a solid. That is not the case for our \(S\text{.}\) So in order to apply the divergence theorem in the current problem, we have to enlarge \(S\) to the boundary of a solid. There are many ways to do this. But they all appear fairly complicated. So it does not seem wise to use the divergence theorem.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So it looks like we have to evaluate the flux integral directly. To do so, we have to determine \(\hn\,\dee{S}\) for the specified rectangle. Look at the sketch of \(S\) below. It is part of a plane,</p>
