<p>Our tangent line can be thought of as the end of this process — namely as we  bring \(Q\) closer and closer to \(P\text{,}\) the slope of the secant line comes  closer and closer to that of the tangent line we want. Since we have worked out  what the slope is — that is the limit we saw just above — we now know  the slope of the tangent line is \(2\text{.}\) Given this, we can work out the  equation for the tangent line.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The equation for the line is \(y=mx+c\text{.}\) We have 2 unknowns \(m\) and \(c\) —  so we need 2 pieces of information to find them.</li>
<li>Since the line is tangent to \(P = (1,1)\) we know the line must pass  through \((1,1)\text{.}\) From the limit we computed above, we also know that the line  has slope \(2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since the slope is \(2\) we know that \(m=2\text{.}\) Thus the equation of the line  is \(y=2x+c\text{.}\)</li>
<li>We know that the line passes through \((1, 1)\text{,}\) so that \(y=2x+c\) must be \(1\) when \(x=1\text{.}\) So \(1 = 2 \cdot 1 + c\text{,}\) which forces \(c = -1\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So our tangent line is \(y=2x-1\text{.}\)</p>
