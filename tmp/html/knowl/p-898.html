<p>Now the break-down</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">Let \(a \lt b\) and let \(f\) be a function that is continuous at all  points \(a\leq x \leq b\text{.}\)</em> — This is setting the scene. We have \(a,b\) with  \(a \lt b\) (we can safely assume these to be real numbers). Our function must  be continuous at all points between \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">if \(Y\) is any number between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\)</em> — Now we need  another number \(Y\) and the only restriction on it is that it lies between  \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\text{.}\) That is, if \(f(a)\leq f(b)\) then \(f(a) \leq Y \leq f(b)\text{.}\) Or  if \(f(a) \geq f(b)\) then \(f(a) \geq Y \geq f(b)\text{.}\) So notice that \(Y\) could be  equal to \(f(a)\) or \(f(b)\) — if we wanted to avoid that possibility, then we  would normally explicitly say \(Y \neq f(a), f(b)\) or we would write that \(Y\)  is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">strictly</em> between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">there exists some number \(c \in [a,b]\) so that \(f(c) = Y\)</em> — so  if we satisfy all of the above conditions, then there has to be some real  number \(c\) lying between \(a\) and \(b\) so that when we evaluate \(f(c)\) it is \(Y\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So that breaks down the proof statement by statement, but what does it actually  mean?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Draw any continuous function you like between \(a\) and \(b\) — it must be continuous.</li>
<li>The function takes the value \(f(a)\) at \(x=a\) and \(f(b)\) at \(x=b\) — see  the left-hand figure above.</li>
<li>Now we can pick any \(Y\) that lies between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) — see the  middle figure above. The IVT <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-45-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.6.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> tells us that  there must be some \(x\)-value that when plugged into the function gives us \(Y\text{.}\)  That is, there is some \(c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(f(c) = Y\text{.}\) We can also interpret  this graphically; the IVT tells us that the horizontal straight line \(y=Y\) must intersect  the graph \(y=f(x)\) at some point \((c,Y)\) with \(a\le c\le b\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Notice that the IVT does not tell us how many such \(c\)-values there are,  just that there is at least one of them. See the right-hand figure above. For  that particular choice of \(Y\) there are three different \(c\) values so that  \(f(c_1) = f(c_2) = f(c_3) = Y\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">This theorem says that if \(f(x)\) is a continuous function on all of the  interval \(a \leq x \leq b\) then as \(x\) moves from \(a\) to \(b\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) takes every value between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) at least once. To put this slightly  differently, if \(f\) were to avoid a value between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) then \(f\)  cannot be continuous on \([a,b]\text{.}\)</p>
