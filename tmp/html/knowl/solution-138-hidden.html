<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A good approximation from the graph is \(f(5)=0.5\text{.}\) We want to find a secant line whose endpoints are both very close to \(x=5\text{,}\) but that also give us clear \(y\)-values. It looks like \(f(5.25) \approx 1\text{,}\) and \(f(4.75)\approx \frac{1}{8}\text{.}\) The secant line from \(x=5\) to \(x=5.25\) has approximate slope \(\dfrac{f(5.25)-f(5)}{5.25-5}\approx \dfrac{1-.5}{.25}=2\text{.}\) The secant line from \(x=5\) to \(x=4.75\) has approximate slope \(\dfrac{0.5-\frac{1}{8}}{5-4.75}=\dfrac{3}{2}\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The graph increases more and more quickly (gets steeper and steeper), so it makes sense that the secant line to the left of \(x=5\) has a smaller slope than the secant line to the right of \(x=5\text{.}\)  Also, if you're taking secant lines that have endpoints farther out from \(x=5\text{,}\) you'll notice that the slopes of the secant lines change quite dramatically. You have to be very, very close to \(x=5\) to get any kind of accuracy.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If we split the difference, we might approximate the slope of the secant line to be the average of \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(2\text{,}\) which is \(\frac{7}{4}\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Another way to try to figure out the tangent line is by carefully drawing it in with a ruler. This is shown here in blue:</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:17%;margin-right:17%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-110.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It's much easier to take the slope of a line than a curve, and this one looks like it has slope about 1.5. However, we drew this with a computer: by hand it's much harder to draw an accurate tangent line. (That's why we need calculus!)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The actual slope of the tangent line to the function at \(x=5\) is about \(1.484\text{.}\) This is extremely hard to figure out just from the graph--by hand, a guess between \(1.25\) and \(1.75\) would be very accurate.</p>
