<p>The signs of both components of \(\vr(t)\) are the same as the signs of the components of \(\cos t\,\hi +\sin t\,\hj\text{;}\) and the signs of both components of \(\vr'(t)\) are the same as the signs of the components of \(-\sin t\,\hi +\cos t\,\hj\text{.}\) Consequently the astroid looks somewhat like a circle in that</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>when \(0\le t\le \frac{\pi}{2}\text{,}\) \(\vr(t)\) lies in the first quadrant and moves upward and to the left as \(t\) increases and</li>
<li>when \(\frac{\pi}{2}\le t\le \pi\text{,}\) \(\vr(t)\) lies in the second quadrant and moves downward and to the left as \(t\) increases and</li>
<li>when \(\pi\le t\le \frac{3\pi}{2}\text{,}\) \(\vr(t)\) lies in the third quadrant and moves downward and to the right as \(t\) increases and</li>
<li>when \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\le t\le 2\pi\text{,}\) \(\vr(t)\) lies in the fourth quadrant and moves upward and to the right as \(t\) increases and</li>
<li>\(\vr(2\pi)=\vr(0)\) so that the astroid is a closed curve that circumnavigates the origin exactly once as \(t\) runs from \(0\) to \(2\pi\text{.}\)</li>
