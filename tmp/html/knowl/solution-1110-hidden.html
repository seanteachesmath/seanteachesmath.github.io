<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For QuestionsÂ <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_1cable.html" title="Exercise 7.1.2.11: 2016Q3">11</a> and <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_1firewood.html" title="Exercise 7.1.2.15">15</a> in this section, we gave two methods for finding the work involved in pulling up a cable: one where we consider pulling up the entire remaining cable a tiny distance of \(\dee{y}\text{,}\) and one where we consider pulling a tiny slice of cable of length \(\dee{y}\) the entire distance up.</p>
<p>There is another variation we can consider with the weight: we can either calculate the work done on the weight and the work done on the rope separately, or we can calculate them together. If we calculate them together, then there are two cases to consider: the work done pulling up the first 5 metres of rope involves the weight, while the last 5 metres does not. These two choices (how to model the rope, and how to deal with the weight) actually lead to four solutions, but to avoid unnecessary repetition only two are presented below.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Solution 1: In this solution, we consider the work on the rope separately from work on the weight, and we imagine lifting a tiny piece of rope the entire distance to the window.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The weight has a mass of 5 kg, and is lifted a distance of 5 m to the window. The force of gravity acting on the weight is \((5 \text{ kg})(9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2) = 49\) N, so the work to lift it 5 metres is \((49\text{ N})(5\text{ m}) = \textcolor{red}{245}\text{J}\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:37.5%;margin-right:37.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-847.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>The density of the rope is \(\frac{1}{10}\) kg/m. A tiny piece of rope of length \(\dee{y}\text{,}\) hanging \(y\) metres from the window, has mass (\(\frac{1}{10}\,\dee{y}\)) kg, and needs to be lifted \(y\) metres. So, the force of gravity acting on the piece of rope is \((\frac{1}{10}\,\dee{y} \text{ kg})\left(9.8\text{ m/sec}^2\right) = 0.98\,\dee{y}\) N, and the work to pull it up to the window is \((0.98y\,\dee{y})\) J. So, the total work to pull up the rope is</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{10} 0.98y\,\dee{y} = 0.98\left[\frac{y^2}{2}\right]_0^{10}=\textcolor{blue}{49\text{ J}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">All together, the work to pull up the rope with the weight is \(\textcolor{red}{245}+\textcolor{blue}{49}=294\) J.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Solution 2: In this solution, we consider the work on the rope together with the weight, and we imagine lifting the remaining rope a tiny distance to the window.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose \(y\) metres of the rope have been pulled in, and \(0 \le y \le 5\) (shown on the left, below). Then the remaining rope has length \(10-y\text{,}\) and contains the weight, so the mass remaining to be pulled up is \(\underbrace{\frac{1}{10}(10-y)}_{\text{rope}} + \underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{10}}5}_{\text{weight}} = 6-\frac{y}{10}\) kg. Then the force of gravity acting on the dangling rope and weight is \((9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2)((6-\frac{y}{10})\text{ kg}) =\left(58.8-0.98y\right)\) N. The work needed to lift this rope \(\dee{y}\) metres is \(\textcolor{red}{\left(58.8-0.98y\right)\dee{y} J}\text{.}\)</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, suppose \(y\) metres of the rope have been pulled in, and \(5  \lt  y \le 10\) (shown above, right). Then the remaining rope has length \(10-y\text{,}\) but <em class="emphasis">does not contain</em> the weight, so the mass remaining to be pulled up is \(\frac{1}{10}(10-y) = 1-\frac{y}{10}\) kg. Then the force of gravity acting on the dangling rope is \((9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2)((1-\frac{y}{10})\text{ kg}) =\left(9.8-0.98y\right)\) N. The work needed to lift this rope \(\dee{y}\) metres is \(\textcolor{blue}{\left(9.8-0.98y\right)\dee{y} J}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>All together, the work needed to lift the rope is</p>
