<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the last example, we found the points on a specified surface having the largest and smallest values of \(z\text{.}\) We'll now ramp up the level of difficulty a bit and find the points on the surface \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\) that have the largest and smallest values of \(x+y+3z\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To develop a strategy for tackling this problem, consider the following sketch.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:12.5%;margin-right:12.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="figs/bigSmall.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>The red ellipse in the sketch is intended to represent (schematically) our surface</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">which is an ellipsoid. The middle diagonal (black) line is intended to represent (schematically) the plane \(x+y+3z=C\) for some more or less randomly chosen value of the constant C. At each point on that plane, the function, \(x+y+3z\text{,}\) (that we are trying to maximize and minimize) takes the value \(C\text{.}\) In particular, for the \(C\) chosen in the figure, \(x+y+3z=C\) does intersect our surface, indicating that \(x+y+3z\) does indeed take the value \(C\) somewhere on our surface.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To maximize \(x+y+3z\text{,}\) imagine slowly increasing the value of \(C\text{.}\) As we do so, the plane \(x+y+3z=C\) moves to the right. We want to stop increasing \(C\) at the biggest value of \(C\) for which the plane \(x+y+3z=C\) intersects our surface \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\text{.}\) For that value of \(C\) the plane \(x+y+3z=C\text{,}\) which is represented by the right hand blue line in the sketch, is tangent to our surface.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Similarly, to minimize \(x+y+3z\text{,}\) imagine slowly decreasing the value of \(C\text{.}\) As we do so, the plane \(x+y+3z=C\) moves to the left. We want to stop decreasing \(C\) at the smallest value of \(C\) for which the plane \(x+y+3z=C\) intersects our surface \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\text{.}\) For that value of \(C\) the plane \(x+y+3z=C\text{,}\) which is represented by the left hand blue line in the sketch, is again tangent to our surface. The previous Example <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_tan_plane_E.html" title="Example 10.5.10">10.5.10</a> was similar, except that the plane was \(z=C\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We are now ready to compute. We need to find the points \((a,b,c)\) (in the sketch, they are the black dot points of tangency) for which</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>\((a,b,c)\) is on the surface and</li>
<li>the normal vector to the surface \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\) at \((a,b,c)\) is parallel to \(\llt 1,1,3\rgt\text{,}\) which is a normal vector to the plane \(x+y+3z=C\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Since the gradient of \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2\) is \(\llt 2x\,,\,4y\,,\,6z\rgt=2\llt x\,,\,2y\,,\,3z\rgt\text{,}\) these two conditions are, in equations,</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
a^2+ 2b^2 +3c^2 &amp;= 72\\
\llt a\,,\,2b\,,\,3c\rgt &amp;=t \llt 1,1,3\rgt\qquad
\text{for some number } t
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The second equation says that \(a=t\text{,}\) \(b=\frac{t}{2}\) and \(c=t\text{.}\) Substituting this into the first equation gives</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
t^2+ \frac{1}{2}t^2 +3t^2 &amp;= 72
\iff \frac{9}{2}t^2=72
\iff t^2 = 16
\iff t=\pm 4
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the point on the surface  \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\) at which \(x+y+3z\) takes its maximum value is \((a,b,c) = \big(t,\frac{t}{2},t\big)\Big|_{t=4}=(4,2,4)\) and</li>
<li>\(x+y+3z\) takes the value \(4+2+3\times 4 =18\) there.</li>
<li>The point on the surface  \(x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72\) at which \(x+y+3z\) takes its minimum value is \((a,b,c)
=\big(t,\frac{t}{2},t\big)\Big|_{t=-4}= (-4,-2,-4)\) and</li>
<li>\(x+y+3z\) takes the value \(-4-2+3\times (-4) =-18\) there.</li>
