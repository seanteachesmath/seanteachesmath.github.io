<li>To pump the water from Tank \(A\) to Tank \(B\text{,}\) we need to pump all the water from Tank \(A\) to a height of 3 m. How much work is done to pump all the water from Tank \(A\) to a height of 3 m? You may model the water as a point mass, originally situated at the centre of mass of the full Tank \(A\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Suppose we could move the water from Tank \(A\) directly to its final position in Tank \(B\) without going over the top of Tank \(B\text{.}\) (For example, maybe tank \(A\) is elastic, and Tank \(B\) is just Tank \(A\) after being smooshed into a different form.) How much work is done pumping the water? (That is, how much work is done moving a point mass from the centre of mass of Tank \(A\) to the centre of mass of Tank \(B\text{?}\))</li>
<li>What percentage of work from part (a) was “wasted” by pumping the water over the top of Tank \(B\text{,}\) instead of moving it directly to its final position?</li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">You may assume that the only work done is against the acceleration due to gravity, \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\text{,}\) and that the density of water is 1000 kg/m\(^3\text{.}\)</p>
