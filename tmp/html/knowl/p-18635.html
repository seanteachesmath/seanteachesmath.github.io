<li>If \(C\) were the graph \(y=f(x)\text{,}\) then \(f'(x)\) would have two points of discontinuity. The curvature \(\ka(x)\) would not the defined at those two points. The function whose graph is \(D\) is defined everywhere and so cannot be the curvature of the function whose graph is \(C\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The function whose graph is \(D\) has two inflection points. So its curvature is zero at two points. The function whose graph is \(C\) is indeed zero at two points (that in fact correspond to the inflection points of \(D\)). So \(D\) is the graph of \(f(x)\) and \(C\) is the graph of \(\kappa(x)\text{.}\)</li>
