<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">There is a key detail in the statement of QuestionÂ <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/p1_1cartime.html" title="Exercise 6.1.8.34: 2016Q1">34</a>: namely, that the car is continuously accelerating. So, although we don't know exactly what's going on in between our brief snippets of information, we know that the car is not going any faster during an interval than at the end of that interval. Therefore, the car certainly travelled no farther than our estimation.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We ask this question in order to point out an important detail. If we did not have the information that the car was continuously accelerating, we would not be able to give a certain upper bound on its distance travelled. It would be possible that, when the car is not being observed (for example, when \(t=0.25\)), it is going much faster than when it is being observed.</p>
