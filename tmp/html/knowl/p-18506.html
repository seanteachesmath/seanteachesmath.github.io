<p>As we have seen, the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Greens' theorem and Stokes' theorem share a number of common features. There is in fact a single framework which encompasses and generalizes all of them, and there is a single theorem of which they are all special cases. We now give a bare bones introduction to this framework and theorem. A proper treatment typically takes up a good part of a full course. Here is an outline of what we shall do:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>First, we will define <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">differential forms</dfn>. To try and keep things as simple and concrete as possible, we'll only define<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-698-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.7.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> differential forms on \(\bbbr^3\) — all of our functions will be defined on \(\bbbr^3\text{.}\) Very roughly speaking, a \(k\)-form is what you write after the integral sign of an integral over a \(k\) dimensional object. Here \(k\) is one of \(0\text{,}\) \(1\text{,}\) \(2\text{,}\) \(3\text{.}\)  As a example, a \(1\)-form is an expression of the form \(F_1(x,y,z)\,\dee{x}
+ F_2(x,y,z)\,\dee{y}
+ F_3(x,y,z)\,\dee{z}\text{.}\) For \(k=0\text{,}\) think of a point as a zero dimensional object and think of evaluating a function at a point as “integrating the function over the point”.</li>
<li>
<p>Then we will define some operations on differential forms, so that we can add them, multiply them, differentiate them and, eventually, integrate them.  The derivative of a \(k\)-form \(\om\) is a \((k+1)\)-form that is denoted \(\dee{\om}\text{.}\) It will turn out that</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>differentiating a \(0\)-form amounts to taking a gradient,</li>
<li>differentiating a \(1\)-form amounts to taking a curl, and</li>
<li>differentiating a \(2\)-form amounts to taking a divergence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally we will get to the generalized Stokes' theorem which says that, if \(\om\) is a \(k\)-form (with \(k=0,1,2\)) and \(D\) is a \((k+1)\)-dimensional domain of integration, then</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_D d\om=\int_{\partial D}\om
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">It will turn out that</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>when \(k=0\text{,}\) this is just the fundamental theorem of calculus and</li>
<li>when \(k=1\text{,}\) this is both Green's theorem and our Stokes' theorem, and</li>
<li>when \(k=2\text{,}\) this is the divergence theorem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
