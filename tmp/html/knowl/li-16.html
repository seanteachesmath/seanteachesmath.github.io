<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Natural numbers — These are the “whole numbers” 1,2,3,… that we learn first at about the same time as we learn the alphabet. We will denote this collection of numbers by the symbol “\(\mathbb{N}\)”. The symbol \(\mathbb{N}\) is written in a type of bold-face font that we call “black-board bold” (and is definitely <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same symbol as \(N\)). You should become used to writing a few letters in this way since it is typically used to denote collections of important numbers.  Unfortunately there is often some confusion as to whether or not zero should be included <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. In this text the natural numbers does not include zero.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Notice that the set of natural numbers is <em class="emphasis">closed</em> under addition and multiplication. This means that if you take any two natural numbers and add them you get another natural number. Similarly if you take any two natural numbers and multiply them you get another natural number. However the set is not closed under subtraction or division; we need negative numbers and fractions to make collections of numbers closed under subtraction and division.</p>
<p>Two important subsets of natural numbers are:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Prime numbers — a natural number is prime when the only natural numbers that divide it exactly are 1 and itself. Equivalently it cannot be written as the product of two natural numbers neither of which are 1. Note that 1 is not a prime number <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.</li>
<li>Composite numbers — a natural number is a composite number when it is not prime.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Hence the number \(7\) is prime, but \(6 = 3\times 2\) is composite.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#li-16">in-context</a></span>
