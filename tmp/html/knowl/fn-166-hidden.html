<body><div class="fn">Named for the 17th century mathematician, Guillaume de l'Hôpital, who published the first textbook on differential calculus. The eponymous rule appears in that text, but is believed to have been developed by Johann Bernoulli. The book was the source of some controversy since it contained many results by Bernoulli, which l'Hôpital acknowledged in the preface, but Bernoulli felt that l'Hôpital got undue credit.<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">

</div> Note that around that time l'Hôpital's name was commonly spelled l'Hospital, but the spelling of silent s in French was changed subsequently; many texts spell his name l'Hospital. If you find yourself in Paris, you can hunt along Boulevard de l'Hôpital for older street signs carved into the sides of buildings which spell it “l'Hospital” — though arguably there are better things to do there.</div></body>
