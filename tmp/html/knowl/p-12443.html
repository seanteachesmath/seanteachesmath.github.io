<p>Suppose that we are passing through the point \((x,y)=(a,b)\) and that we are walking parallel to the \(x\)-axis (in the positive direction). Then our \(y\)-coordinate will be constant, always taking the value \(y=b\text{.}\) So we can think of the measured temperature as the function of one variable \(B(x) = f(x,b)\) and we will observe the rate of change of temperature</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{B}{x}(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{B(a+h) - B(a)}{h}
= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This is called the “partial derivative \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at \((a,b)\)” and is denoted \(\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)\text{.}\) Here</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the symbol \(\partial\text{,}\) which is read “partial”, indicates that we are dealing with a function of more than one variable, and</li>
<li>the \(x\) in \({\pdiff{f}{x}}\) indicates that we are differentiating with respect to \(x\text{,}\) while \(y\) is being held fixed, i.e. being treated as a constant.</li>
<li>\({\pdiff{f}{x}}\) is read “partial dee \(f\) dee \(x\)”.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Do not write \(\diff{}{x}\) when \(\pdiff{}{x}\) is appropriate. We shall later encounter situations when \(\diff{}{x}f\) and \(\pdiff{}{x}f\) are both defined and have different meanings.</p>
