<p>Newton's law of cooling says:</p>
<ul class="disc"><li>The rate of change of temperature of an object is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings. The temperature of the surroundings is sometimes called the ambient  temperature.</li></ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">If we denote by \(T(t)\) the temperature of the object at time \(t\) and by \(A\) the temperature of its surroundings, Newton's law of cooling says that there is some constant of proportionality, \(K\text{,}\) such that <article class="fact theorem-like"><h6 xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="heading">

\begin{equation*}

</div></article> This mathematical model of temperature change works well when  studying a small object in a large, fixed temperature, environment.  For example, a hot cup of coffee in a large room <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-303-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.4.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>. Let's start by thinking a little about the sign of the constant of proportionality. At any time \(t\text{,}\) there are three possibilities.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If \(T(t) \gt A\text{,}\) that is, if the body is warmer than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the body into its surroundings and so we would expect the body to cool off so that  \(\diff{T}{t}(t) \lt 0\text{.}\) For this  expectation to be consistent with (<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Equation 4.3.7: Newton's law of cooling">4.3.7</a>), we need \(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(T(t) \lt A\text{,}\) that is the body is cooler than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the surroundings into the body and so we would expect the body to warm up so that  \(\diff{T}{t}(t) \gt 0\text{.}\) For this  expectation to be consistent with (<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Equation 4.3.7: Newton's law of cooling">4.3.7</a>), we again need \(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Finally if \(T(t)=A\text{,}\) that is the body and its environment have the same temperature, we would not expect any heat to flow between the two and so we would expect that \(\diff{T}{t}(t)=0\text{.}\) This does not impose any condition on \(K\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">In conclusion, we would expect \(K \lt 0\text{.}\) Of course, we could have chosen to call the constant of proportionality \(-k\text{,}\) rather than \(K\text{.}\) Then the differential equation would be  \(\diff{T}{t} = -k\big(T-A\big)\) and we would expect \(k \gt 0\text{.}\)</p>
