<p>Different forces are acting on you  (1) after you jump but before you land on the trampoline, and (2) while you are falling into the trampoline. In both instances, the acceleration is constant, so both height functions are quadratic, of the form \(\frac{a}{2}t^2+vt+h\text{,}\) where \(a\) is the acceleration, \(v\) is the velocity when \(t=0\text{,}\) and \(h\) is the initial height.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Let's consider (1) first, the time during your jump before your feet touch the trampoline. Let \(t=0\) be the moment you jump, and  let the rim of the trampoline be height \(0\text{.}\) Then, since your initial velocity was (positive) \(1\) meter per second, your height is given by</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h_1(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+t=t\left(\frac{-9.8}{2}t+1\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Notice that, because your acceleration is working against your positive velocity, it has a negative sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We'll need to know your velocity when your feet first touch the trampoline on your fall. The time your feet first first touch the trampoline after your jump is precisely when \(h_1(t)=0\) and \(t \gt 0\text{.}\) That is, when \(t=\frac{2}{9.8}\text{.}\) Now, since \(h'(t)=-9.8t+1\text{,}\) \(h'\left(\frac{2}{9.8}\right)=-9.8\left(\frac{2}{9.8}\right)+1=-1\text{.}\) So, you are descending at a rate of 1 metre per second at the instant your feet touch the trampoline.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remark: it is not only coincidence that this was your initial speed. Think about the symmetries of parabolas, and conservation of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to think about your height as the trampoline is slowing your fall. One thing to remember about our general equation \(\frac{a}{2}t^2+vt+h\) is that \(v\) is the velocity when \(t=0\text{.}\) But, you don't hit the trampoline at \(t=0\text{,}\) you hit it at \(t=\frac{2}{9.8}\text{.}\) In order to keep things simple, let's use a <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">different</em> time scale for this second part of your journey. Let's let \(h_2(T)\) be your height at time \(T\text{,}\) from the moment your feet touch the trampoline skin (\(T=0\)) to the bottom of your fall. Now, we can use the fact that your initial velocity is \(-1\) metres per second (negative, since your height is decreasing) and your acceleration is \(4.9\) metres per second per second (positive, since your velocity is increasing from a negative number to zero):</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h_2(T)=\frac{4.9}{2}T^2-T
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">where still the height of the rim of the trampoline is taken to be zero.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remark: if it seems very confusing that your free-falling acceleration is negative, while your acceleration in the trampoline is positive, remember that gravity is pushing you down, but the trampoline is pushing you up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long were  you falling in the trampoline? The equation \(h_2(T)\) tells you your height only as long as the trampoline is slowing your fall. You reach the bottom of your fall when your velocity is zero.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h_2'(T)=4.9T-1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">so you reach the bottom of your fall at \(T=\frac{1}{4.9}\text{.}\) Be careful: this is \(\frac{1}{4.9}\) seconds <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">after you entered the trampoline</em>, not after the peak of your fall, or after you jumped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is how long it took you to fall from the peak of your jump to the surface of the trampoline. We know the equation of your motion during that time: \(h_1(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+t\text{.}\) You reached the peak when your velocity was zero:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h_1'(t)=-9.8t+1 =0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad t=\frac{1}{9.8}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So, you fell from your peak at \(t=\frac{1}{9.8}\) and reached the level of the trampoline rim at \(t=\frac{2}{1.98}\text{,}\) which means the fall took \(\frac{1}{9.8}\) seconds.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remark: by the symmetry mentioned early, the time it took to fall from the peak of your jump to the surface of the trampoline is the same as one-half the time from the moment you jumped off the rim to the moment you're back on the surface of the trampoline.</p>
</li>
<li>So, your time falling from the peak of your jump to its bottom was \(\frac{1}{9.8}+\frac{1}{4.9}\approx 0.3\) seconds.</li>
