<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We defined \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\text{:}\)  that is, the length of one interval, when we chop \([a,b]\) into \(n\) of them. If \(b\) and \(a\) are measured in metres, then \(\Delta x\) is measured in metres as well. So, the units of \(\Delta x\) are metres.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Put another way, since \(a\) and \(b\) both describe a quantity in metres, \(b-a\) describes a quantity in metres as well. (When we add or subtract quantities of the same units, their sum or difference is given in the same units.) Since \(n\) is a unitless quantity (simply a number: not “\(n\) kg” or “\(n\) m”), \(\frac{b-a}{n}\) still describes a quantity in metres. (If I have 6 metres of cloth, and I cut it into 3 pieces, each piece has \(\frac{6}{3}=2\) metres — not 2 kilograms, or 2 metres per second.)</p>
</li>
<li>Since \(F(x)\) is measured in kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons), the units of \(F(x_i)\) are kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons).</li>
<li>\(W\) is calculated by adding up summands of the form \(F(x_i)\Delta x\text{.}\) The units of \(F(x_i)\Delta x\) are the products of the units of \(F(x_i)\) with the units of \(\Delta x\text{.}\) That is, the units of \(F(x_i)\Delta x\) are \(\left(\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right)\left(\text{m}\right) = \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{sec}^2} = J\text{.}\) The sum of terms given in joules is itself given in joules, so the units of \(W\) are joules.</li>
