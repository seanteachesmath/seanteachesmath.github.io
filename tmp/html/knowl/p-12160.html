<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We all have a fair bit of experience drawing curves in two dimensions. Typically the intersection of a surface (in three dimensions) with a plane is a curve lying in the (two dimensional) plane. Such an intersection is usually called a cross-section. In the special case that the plane is one of the coordinate planes, the intersection is sometimes called a trace. One can often get a pretty good idea of what a surface looks like by sketching a bunch of cross-sections. Here are some examples.</p>
