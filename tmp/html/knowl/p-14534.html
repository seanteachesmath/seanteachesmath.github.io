<p>We wish to compute its area, which we'll call \(\dee{S}\text{.}\) Now this little piece of surface need not be parallel to the \(xy\)-plane, and indeed need not even be flat. But if the piece is really tiny, it's almost flat. We'll now approximate it by something that is flat, and whose area we know. To start, we'll determine the corners of the piece. To do so, we first determine the bounding curves of the piece. Look at the figure above, and recall that, on the surface \(z=f(x,y)\text{.}\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The  upper blue curve was constructed by holding \(x\) fixed at the value \(x_0\text{,}\) and sketching the curve swept out by \(x_0\,\hi+y\,\hj + f(x_0,y)\,\hk\) as \(y\) varied, and</li>
<li>the  lower blue curve was constructed by holding \(x\) fixed at the slightly larger value \(x_0+\dee{x}\text{,}\) and sketching the curve swept out by  \((x_0+\dee{x})\,\hi+y\,\hj + f(x_0+\dee{x},y)\,\hk\) as \(y\) varied.</li>
<li>The red curves were constructed similarly, by holding \(y\) fixed and varying \(x\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So the four intersection points in the figure are</p>

<p data-braille="continuation">Of course we have only approximated the positions of the corners and so have introduced errors. However, with more work, one can bound those errors (like we in the optional §<a href="sec_polars.html#sec_integral_error" class="internal" title="Subsection 11.2.4: Optional— Error Control for the Polar Area Formula&gt;">11.2.4</a>) and show that in the limit \(\dee{x},\dee{y}\rightarrow 0\text{,}\) all of the error terms that we dropped contribute exactly \(0\) to the integral.</p>
