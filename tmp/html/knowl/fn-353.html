</h6>This is a little beyond the scope of the course. Roughly  speaking, think about what would happen if the limit of the  ratios did exist. If the limit were smaller than \(1\text{,}\)  then it would tell you that the terms of our series must be  getting smaller and smaller and smaller — which is impossible  because they are all integers between 1 and 10. Similarly if the  limit existed and were bigger than \(1\) then the terms  of the series would have to get bigger and bigger and bigger —  also impossible. Hence if the ratio exists then it  must be equal to 1 — but in that case because the terms are integers, they would have to be all equal when \(n\)  became big enough. But that means that the expansion of \(\pi\)  would be eventually periodic —  something that only rational numbers do (a proof is given in the  optional §<a href="sec_RatIrr.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.7: Optional — Rational and irrational numbers">8.7</a> at the end of this chapter).</div>
