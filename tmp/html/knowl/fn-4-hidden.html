<body><div class="fn">The existence of such numbers caused mathematicians (particularly the ancient Greeks) all sorts of philosophical problems. They thought that the natural numbers were somehow fundamental and beautiful and “natural”. The rational numbers you can get very easily by taking “ratios” — a process that is still somehow quite sensible. There were quite influential philosophers (in Greece at least) called Pythagoreans (disciples of Pythagoras originally) who saw numbers as almost mystical objects explaining all the phenomena in the universe, including beauty — famously they found fractions in musical notes etc and “numbers constitute the entire heavens”. They believed that everything could be explained by whole numbers and their ratios. But soon after Pythagoras' theorem was discovered, so were numbers that are not rational. The first proof of the existence of irrational numbers is sometimes attributed to Hippasus in around 400BCE (not really known). It seems that his philosopher “friends” were not very happy about this and essentially exiled him. Some accounts suggest that he was drowned by them.</div></body>
