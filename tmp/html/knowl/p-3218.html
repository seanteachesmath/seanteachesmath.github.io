<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The point is moving along a straight line. So, to take care of complication (2), we can give its position as a point on the line. We can take the line as a sort of axis. We'll need to choose a point on the axis to be the “origin”: \((2,1)\) is a convenient point. Let \(D\) be the point's (signed) distance along the “axis” from \((2,1)\text{.}\) When the point is a distance of one unit to the left of \((2,1)\text{,}\) we'll have \(D=-1\text{,}\) and when the point is a distance of one unit to the right of \((2,1)\text{,}\) we'll have \(D=1\text{.}\) Then \(D\) changes with respect to time, and \(\ds\diff{D}{t}\) is the velocity of the point. Since we know \(\ds\diff{x}{t}\) and \(\ds\diff{y}{t}\text{,}\) a reasonable plan is to find an equation relating \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(D\text{,}\) and differentiate implicitly with respect to \(t\text{.}\) (This implicit differentiation takes care of complication (1).) Using the Pythagorean Theorem:</p>
