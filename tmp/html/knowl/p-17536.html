<p>The rest of this chapter concerns three theorems: the divergence theorem, Green's theorem and Stokes' theorem. Superficially, they look quite different from each other. But, in fact, they are all <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">very</em> closely related and all three are generalizations of the fundamental theorem of calculus</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b \diff{f}{t}(t)\ \dee{t}
= f(b) -f(a)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The left hand side of the fundamental theorem of calculus is the integral of the derivative of a function. The right hand side involves only values of the function on the boundary of the domain of integration. The divergence theorem, Green's theorem and Stokes' theorem also have this form, but the integrals are in more than one dimension. So the derivatives are multidimensional, like the curl and divergence, and the integrands can involve vector fields.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>For the divergence theorem, the integral on the left hand side is over a (three dimensional) volume and the right hand side is an integral over the boundary of the volume, which is a surface.</li>
<li>For Green's and Stokes' theorems, the integral on the left hand side is over a (two dimensional) surface and the right hand side is an integral over the boundary of the surface, which is a curve.</li>
