<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As we said above we will define a 1-form as an expression of the form \(F_1(x,y,z)\,\dee{x}
+ F_2(x,y,z)\,\dee{y}
+ F_3(x,y,z)\,\dee{z}\text{.}\) When you learned the definition of the integral the symbol “\(\dee{x}\)” was not given any mathematical meaning by itself. A meaning was given only to collections of symbols like the indefinite integral “\(\int f(x)\ \dee{x}\)” and the definite integral “\(\int_a^b f(x)\ \dee{x}\)”. Later in this section, we will give a meaning to \(\dee{x}\text{.}\) We will, in Definition <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_differentialFormDiff.html" title="Definition 15.7.9: Differentiation of differential forms">15.7.9</a>, define a differentiation operator that we will call \(\dee{}\text{.}\) Then \(\dee{x}\) will be that differentiation operator applied to the function \(f(x)=x\text{.}\) However, until then we will have to treat \(\dee{x}\) and \(\dee{y}\) and \(\dee{z}\) just as symbols. Their sole role in \(F_1(x,y,z)\,\dee{x}
+ F_2(x,y,z)\,\dee{y}
+ F_3(x,y,z)\,\dee{z}\) is to allow us to distinguish<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-699-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.7.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> \(F_1(x,y,z)\text{,}\) \(F_2(x,y,z)\) and \(F_3(x,y,z)\text{.}\)</p>
