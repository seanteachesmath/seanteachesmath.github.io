<p>So to write up our answer we can put something like the following â€”  keeping in mind we need to tell the reader what we are doing so they can follow along easily.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>We will use the IVT to prove that there is a zero in \([0,1]\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>First we must show that the function is continuous.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Since \(x-1\) is a polynomial it is continuous everywhere.</li>
<li>The function \(\sin(\pi x/2)\) is a trigonometric function and is also  continuous everywhere.</li>
<li>The sum of two continuous functions is also continuous, so \(f(x)\) is  continuous everywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let \(a=0, b=1\text{,}\) then<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(0) &amp;= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) &amp;= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
<li>The function is negative at \(x=0\) and positive at \(x=1\text{.}\) Since the  function is continuous we know there is a point \(c \in [0,1]\) so that \(f(c) =  0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Notice that though we have not used full sentences in our explanation here, we  are still using words. Your mathematics, unless it is very straight-forward  computation, should contain words as well as symbols.</p>
