<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In many of our applications in 2d and 3d, we will encounter quantities that have both a magnitude (like a distance) and also a direction. Such quantities are called vectors. That is, a <em class="emphasis">vector</em> is a quantity which has both a direction and a magnitude, like a velocity. If you are moving, the magnitude (length) of your velocity vector is your speed (distance travelled per unit time)  and the direction of your velocity vector is your direction of motion. To specify a vector in three dimensions you have to give three components, just as for a point. To draw the vector with components \(a, b, c \) you can draw an arrow from the point \((0,0,0)\) to the point \((a,b,c)\text{.}\)</p>
