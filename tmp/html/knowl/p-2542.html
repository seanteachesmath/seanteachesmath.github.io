<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider the following situation. Two towns are separated by a 120km long stretch of road. The police in town \(A\) observe a car leaving at 1pm. Their colleagues in town \(B\) see the car arriving at 2pm. After a quick phone call between the two police stations, the driver is issued a fine for going \(120km/h\) at some time between 1pm and 2pm. It is intuitively obvious <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-99-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.13.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> that, because his average velocity was \(120km/h\text{,}\) the driver must have been going at least \(120km/h\) at some point. From a knowledge of the average velocity of the car, we are able to deduce something about an instantaneous velocity <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-100-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.13.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> .</p>
