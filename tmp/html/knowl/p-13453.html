<p>You might also wonder why we cannot draw any conclusions when \(D(a,b)=0\) and what happens then. The second derivative test for functions of two variables was derived in precisely the same way as the second derivative test for functions of one variable is derived â€” you approximate the function by a polynomial that is of degree two in \((x-a)\text{,}\) \((y-b)\) and then you analyze the behaviour of the quadratic polynomial near \((a,b)\text{.}\) For this to work, the contributions to \(f(x,y)\) from terms that are of degree two in  \((x-a)\text{,}\) \((y-b)\) had better be bigger than the contributions to \(f(x,y)\) from terms that are of degree three and higher in  \((x-a)\text{,}\) \((y-b)\) when \((x-a)\text{,}\) \((y-b)\) are really small. If this is not the case, for example when the terms in \(f(x,y)\) that are of degree two in  \((x-a)\text{,}\) \((y-b)\) all have coefficients that are exactly zero, the analysis will certainly break down. That's exactly what happens when \(D(a,b)=0\text{.}\) Here are some examples. The functions</p>
