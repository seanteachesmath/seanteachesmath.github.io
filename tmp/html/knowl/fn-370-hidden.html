<body><div class="fn">It is worth mentioning here that history of this topic is perhaps a little rough on Roger Cotes (1682–1716) who was one of the strongest mathematicians of his time and a collaborator of Newton. Cotes published a paper on logarithms in 1714 in which he states<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
ix = \log( \cos x + i \sin x).
\end{equation*}
</div>(after translating his results into more modern notation). He proved this result by computing in two different ways  the surface area of an ellipse rotated about one axis and equating the results. Unfortunately Cotes died only 2 years  later at the age of 33. Upon hearing of his death Newton is supposed to have said “If he had lived, we might have  known something.” The reader might think this a rather weak statement, however coming from Newton it was high praise.</div></body>
