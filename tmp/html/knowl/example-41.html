<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Show that the function \(f(x) = x-1+\sin(\pi x/2)\) has a zero  in \(0 \leq x \leq 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This question has been set up nicely to lead us towards using the IVT;  we are  already given a nice interval on which to look. In general we might have to  test a few points and experiment a bit with a calculator before we can  start narrowing down a range.</p>
<p>Let us start by testing the endpoints of the interval we are given</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(0) &amp;= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) &amp;= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So we know a point where \(f\) is positive and one where it is negative. So by  the IVT there is a point in between where it is zero.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">BUT</em> in order to apply the IVT we have to show that the function is  continuous, and we cannot simply write</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">it is continuous</p></blockquote>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We need to explain to the reader <em class="emphasis">why</em> it is continuous. That is — we  have to prove it.</p>
<p>So to write up our answer we can put something like the following —  keeping in mind we need to tell the reader what we are doing so they can follow along easily.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>We will use the IVT to prove that there is a zero in \([0,1]\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>First we must show that the function is continuous.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Since \(x-1\) is a polynomial it is continuous everywhere.</li>
<li>The function \(\sin(\pi x/2)\) is a trigonometric function and is also  continuous everywhere.</li>
<li>The sum of two continuous functions is also continuous, so \(f(x)\) is  continuous everywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let \(a=0, b=1\text{,}\) then<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(0) &amp;= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) &amp;= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
<li>The function is negative at \(x=0\) and positive at \(x=1\text{.}\) Since the  function is continuous we know there is a point \(c \in [0,1]\) so that \(f(c) =  0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Notice that though we have not used full sentences in our explanation here, we  are still using words. Your mathematics, unless it is very straight-forward  computation, should contain words as well as symbols.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The zero of this function is actually located at about \(x=0.4053883559\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-12.html#example-41">in-context</a></span>
