<body><div class="fn">Notice here we are using another common piece of mathematical short-hand. Very often in mathematics we will be talking or writing about some object, like the set \(S\) above, and then we will create a closely related object. Rather than calling this new object by a new symbol (we could have used \(T\) or \(R\) or…), we instead use the same symbol but with some sort of accent — such as the little single quote mark we added to the symbol \(S\) to make \(S'\) (read “S prime”). The point of this is to let the reader know that this new object is related to the original one, but not the same. You might also see \(\dot{S}, \hat{S}, \bar{S}, \tilde{S}\) and others.</div></body>
