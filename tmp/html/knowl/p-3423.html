<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the 1950s, pure-bred wood bison were thought to be extinct. However, a small population was found in Canada. For decades, a captive breeding program has been working to increase their numbers, and from time to time wood bison are released to the wild. Suppose in 2015, a released herd numbered 121 animals, and a year later, there were 136 <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-130-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.3.14"><sup> 14 </sup></a>. If the wood bison adhere to the Malthusian model (a big assumption!), and if there are no more releases of captive animals, how many animals will the herd have in 2020?</p>
