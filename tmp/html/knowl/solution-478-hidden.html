<li>[(a)] Since \(f(t)\) gives the amount of  the radioactive isotope in the sample at time \(t\text{,}\) the amount of the radioactive isotope in the sample when \(t=0\) is \(f(0)=100e^0=100\) units. Since the sample is decaying,  \(f(t)\) is decreasing, so \(f'(t)\) is negative. Differentiating, \(f'(t)=k(100e^{kt})\text{.}\) Since \(100e^{kt}\) is positive and \(f'(t)\) is negative, \(k\) is negative.</li>
<li>[(b)] Since \(f(t)\) gives the size of the population at time \(t\text{,}\) the number of individuals in the population when \(t=0\) is \(f(0)=100e^0=100\text{.}\) Since the population is growing,  \(f(t)\) is increasing, so \(f'(t)\) is positive. Differentiating, \(f'(t)=k(100e^{kt})\text{.}\) Since \(100e^{kt}\) is positive and \(f'(t)\) is positive, \(k\) is also positive.</li>
<li>[(c)] Newton's Law of Cooling give the temperature of an object at time \(t\) as \(f(t)=[f(0)-A]e^{kt}+A\text{,}\) where \(A\) is the ambient temperature surrounding the object. In our case, the ambient temperature is 0 degrees. In an object whose temperature is being modelled by Newton's Law of Cooling,  it doesn't matter whether the object is heating or cooling, \(k\) is negative. We saw this in Question <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s3_3_2Knegative.html" title="Exercise 4.3.4.2.3">4.3.4.2.3</a> of Section <a href="sec_ExpGthDecay.html#sec_newtonCooling" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.3.2: Newton's Law of Cooling">4.3.2</a>, but it bears repeating. Since \(f(t)\) approaches the ambient temperature (in this case, 0) as \(t\) goes to infinty:<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty}100e^{kt}=0
\end{equation*}
</div>so \(k\) is negative.</li>
</ul></div></body>
