<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Before we can find \(\pdiff{P}{T}\text{,}\) we first have to decide what it means. This happens regularly in applications. In fact, this particular problem comes from thermodynamics. The variables \(P,\ V,\ T\) are the pressure, volume and temperature, respectively, of some gas. These three variables are not independent. They are related by an equation of state, here denoted \(F(P,V,T)=0\text{.}\) Given values for any two of \(P,\ V,\ T\text{,}\) the third can be found by solving \(F(P,V,T)=0\text{.}\) We are being asked to find \(\pdiff{P}{T}\text{.}\) This implicitly instructs us to treat \(P\text{,}\) in this problem, as the dependent variable. So a careful wording of this problem (which you will never encounter in the “real world”) would be the following. The function \(P(V,T)\) is defined by \(F\big(P(V,T),V,T)=0\text{.}\) Find \(\big(\pdiff{P}{T}\big)_V\text{.}\) That is, find the rate of change of pressure as the temperature is varied, while holding the volume fixed.</p>
