</h6>The heat equation was formulated by the French mathematician and physicist Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier in 1807. He lived from 1768 to 1830, a period which included both the French revolution and the reign of Napoleon. Indeed Fourier served on his local Revolutionary Committee, was imprisoned briefly during the Terror, and was Napoleon Bonaparte's scientific advisor on his Egyptian expedition of 1798. Fourier series and the Fourier transform are named after him. Fourier is also credited with discovering the greenhouse effect.</div>
