<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">On the left-most corner of \(S\text{,}\) \(T(x)=B(x)\text{,}\) so the height of \(S\) is zero; that is, the area of a very small vertical strip is very close to zero, so the density of \(R\) is close to 0. As we move closer to the position labeled \(a'\text{,}\) the height of the strips increases, so the areas of the strips increases, so the density of \(R\) increases. Then, between the points labeled \(a'\) and \(b'\text{,}\) the height of \(S\) remains constant, since \(T(x)\) and \(B(x)\) are parallel here, so the areas of the strips of \(S\) remain constant, and the density of \(R\) remains constant. Then, between \(b'\) and \(b\text{,}\) the height of \(S\) decreases, so the area of the strips decrease, so the density of \(R\) decreases.</p>

<li>At position \(x\text{,}\) the height of \(S\) is \(T(x)-B(x)\text{,}\) so a rectangle with width \(\dee{x}\) and this height would have area \((T(x)-B(x))\,\dee{x}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>According to our model, the tiny section of \(R\) at position \(x\) with width \(\dee{x}\) has mass \((T(x)-B(x))\,\dee{x}\) (that is, the area of \(S\) over this same tiny interval), so its density is \(\rho(x) = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} = \frac{(T(x)-B(x))\,\dee{x}}{\dee{x}} = T(x)-B(x)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Imagine \(S\) were a solid, of constant density. The the mass of a portion of \(S\) is proportional to the area of that portion. To find the \(x\)-coordinate where the solid would balance, we imagine compressing together the vertical dimension of \(S\) until it's a rod. That is, we would take a very thin vertical strip of \(S\text{,}\) and turn it into a small segment of a rod, with the same mass. Then the centre of mass of that rod would be exactly the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of mass of the solid — that is, the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid of \(S\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The compressed rod we form in this way is exactly \(R\) (perhaps multiplied by a constant, to account for the density of \(S\text{,}\) but this doesn't affect where \(R\) balances). So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid has the same position as the centre of mass of \(R\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Our result from Question <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_rod.html" title="Exercise 7.3.3.8">8</a>(<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_rodb.html" title="Item 7.3.3.8.b">b</a>) tells us the centre of mass of \(R\) is</p>

\begin{align*}
&amp; \frac{\int_a^b x\textcolor{red}{\rho(x)}\,\dee{x}}{\int_a^b\textcolor{red}{\rho(x)}\,\dee{x}}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">In (c), we found \(\rho(x)=T(x)-B(x)\text{.}\) So, for  the solid \(S\) bounded by \(T(x)\) and \(B(x)\) on the interval \([a,b]\text{,}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
\bar x&amp;=\frac{\int_a^b x(\textcolor{red}{T(x)-B(x)})\,\dee{x}}{\int_a^b(\textcolor{red}{T(x)-B(x)})\,\dee{x}}

<p data-braille="continuation">Remark: the denominator is the area of \(S\text{.}\) This formula is the same as the formula found in Equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_TRQcentroid.html" title="Equation 7.3.5: Centroid of object with constant density">7.3.5</a>.</p>
