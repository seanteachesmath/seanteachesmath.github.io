<p>Furthermore, imagine that the piece of wood consists of a huge number of particles joined by a huge number of weightless but very strong steel rods. The steel rod joining particle number one to particle number two just represents a force acting between particles number one and two. Suppose that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>there are \(n\) particles, with particle number \(i\) having mass \(m_i\)</li>
<li>at time \(t\text{,}\) particle number \(i\) has \(x\)-coordinate  \(x_i(t)\) and \(y\)-coordinate \(y_i(t)\)</li>
<li>at time \(t\text{,}\)  the external force (gravity and the like) acting on particle number \(i\) has \(x\)-coordinate  \(H_i(t)\) and \(y\)-coordinate \(V_i(t)\text{.}\) Here \(H\) stands for horizontal and \(V\) stands for vertical.</li>
<li>at time \(t\text{,}\) the force acting on particle number \(i\text{,}\) due to the steel rod joining particle number \(i\) to particle number \(j\) has \(x\)-coordinate \(H_{i,j}(t)\) and \(y\)-coordinate \(V_{i,j}(t)\text{.}\) If there is no steel rod joining particles number \(i\) and \(j\text{,}\) just set \(H_{i,j}(t)=V_{i,j}(t)=0\text{.}\) In particular, \(H_{i,i}(t)=V_{i,i}(t)=0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">The only assumptions that we shall make about the steel rod forces are</p>
<dl xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="description-list">
<dt>(A1)</dt>
<dd><p>for each \(i\ne j\text{,}\) \(H_{i,j}(t)=-H_{j,i}(t)\) and \(V_{i,j}(t)=-V_{j,i}(t)\text{.}\) In words, the steel rod joining particles \(i\) and \(j\) applies equal and opposite forces to particles \(i\) and \(j\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>(A2)</dt>
<dd><p>for each \(i\ne j\text{,}\) there is a function \(M_{i,j}(t)\) such that \(H_{i,j}(t)=M_{i,j}(t)\big[x_i(t)-x_j(t)\big]\) and \(V_{i,j}(t)=M_{i,j}(t)\big[y_i(t)-y_j(t)\big]\text{.}\) In words, the force due to the rod joining particles \(i\) and \(j\) acts parallel to the line joining particles \(i\) and \(j\text{.}\) For (A1) to be true, we need  \(M_{i,j}(t)=M_{j,i}(t)\text{.}\)</p></dd>
