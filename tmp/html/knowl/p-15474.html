<p>That figure also contains a (portion of a) red circle that fits the curve really well between the two radial lines that are (a very small) angle \(\dee{\theta}\) apart. So the arclength \(\dee{s}\) of the part of the black curve between the two radial lines, should be (essentially) the same as the arc length of the circle between the two radial lines, which is \(\rho\,|\dee{\theta}|\text{,}\) where \(\rho\) is the radius of the circle. (We put in absolute values to take into account the possibility that \(\dee{\theta}\) could be negative.) Thus \(\dee{s} = \rho\,|\dee{\theta}|\text{.}\) When \(\dee{\theta}\) is a macroscopic angle, this is of course an approximation. But in the limit as \(\dee{\theta}\rightarrow 0\text{,}\) we should end up with</p>

\begin{equation*}
\rho = \left|\diff{s}{\theta}\right|

<p data-braille="continuation">We now have a formula for the radius of curvature, but not in a very convenient form, because to evaluate it we would need to know the arc length along the curve as a function of the angle \(\theta\) in the rightmost figure below. We'll now spend some time developing more convenient formulae for \(\rho\text{.}\) First consider the three figures below. They all show the same curve as in the last figure. The leftmost figure just shows</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the curve of interest, which is the black curve, and</li>
<li>the (blue) point of interest on the black curve. We want to find the curvature at that point.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">The middle figure shows the same curve and point of interest and also shows</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the red circle of curvature (i.e. best fitting circle) for the black curve at the blue dot.</li>
<li>The red dot is the centre of curvature.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">The rightmost figure shows the same black curve, blue point of interest and red circle of curvature (at least part of it) somewhat enlarged.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The angle \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\hi\) and the radius vector from the red dot (the centre of curvature) to the blue dot (the point of interest).</li>
<li>\(\hat\vT\) is the tangent vector to the black curve at the blue dot.</li>
<li>The angle \(\phi\) is the angle between \(\hi\) and \(\hat\vT\text{.}\) The vector \(\hat\vT\) is also tangent to the red circle. As the tangent and radius vectors for circles are perpendicular to each other<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-549-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12.3.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>, we have that \(\phi=\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}\) and hence \(\rho = \big|\diff{s}{\phi}\big|\) too.</li>
