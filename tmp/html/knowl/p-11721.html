<p>In this example, we'll sketch the plane</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P:\ 4x + 3y + 2z = 12
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">A good way to prepare for sketching a plane is to find the intersection points of the plane with the \(x\)-, \(y\)- and \(z\)-axes, just as you are used to doing when sketching lines in the \(xy\)-plane. For example, any point on the \(x\) axis must be of the form \((x,0,0)\text{.}\) For \((x,0,0)\) to also be on \(P\) we need \(x=\frac{12}{4}=3\text{.}\) So \(P\) intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((3,0,0)\text{.}\) Similarly, \(P\) intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0,4,0)\) and the \(z\)-axis at \((0,0,6)\text{.}\) Now plot the points \((3,0,0)\text{,}\) \((0,4,0)\) and \((0,0,6)\text{.}\) \(P\) is the plane containing these three points. Often a visually effective way to sketch a surface in three dimensions is to</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. That is, the part with \(x\ge0\text{,}\) \(y\ge 0\) and \(z\ge 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>To do so, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the \(xy\)-plane in the first octant and,</li>
<li>similarly, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the \(xz\)-plane in the first octant and the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the \(yz\)-plane in the first octant.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">That's what we'll do. The intersection of the plane \(P\) with the \(xy\)-plane is the straight line through the two points \((3,0,0)\) and \((0,4,0)\text{.}\) So the part of that intersection in the first octant is the line segment from \((3,0,0)\) to \((0,4,0)\text{.}\) Similarly the part of the intersection of \(P\) with the \(xz\)-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment from \((3,0,0)\) to \((0,0,6)\) and  the part of the intersection of \(P\) with the \(yz\)-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment from \((0,4,0)\) to \((0,0,6)\text{.}\) So we just have to sketch the three line segments joining the three axis intercepts \((3,0,0)\text{,}\) \((0,4,0)\) and \((0,0,6)\text{.}\) That's it.</p>
