<body><div class="fn">A good way to remember this last step is that we  replace \(\diff{u}{x} \dee{x}\) by just \(\dee{u}\) — which looks  like we cancelled out the \(\dee{x}\) terms: \(\frac{\dee{u}}{\cancel{\dee{x}}}\cancel{\dee{x}} = \dee{u}\text{.}\) While using “cancel the  \(\dee{x}\)” is a good mnemonic (memory aid), you should not think of the derivative  \(\diff{u}{x}\) as a fraction — you are not dividing \(\dee{u}\) by \(\dee{x}\text{.}\)</div></body>
