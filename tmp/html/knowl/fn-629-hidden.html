<body><div class="fn">It doesn't really matter which unit normal we pick here. We just have to be clear which one we're using. With the outward normal, the flux gives the rate at which fluid crosses the sphere in the outward direction. If we were to use the inward pointing normal, the flux would give the rate at which fluid crosses the sphere in the inward direction.</div></body>
