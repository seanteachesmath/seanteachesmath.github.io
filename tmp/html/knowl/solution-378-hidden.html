<p>The function \(f(x)\) is continuous and differentiable over all real numbers. If \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct roots of \(f(x)\text{,}\) then \(f'(c)=0\) for some \(c\) strictly between \(a\) and \(b\) (Rolle's Theorem). So, let's think about \(f'(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=(4x+1)^3+1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is simple enough that we can find its zero explicitly:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
(4x+1)^3 +1= 0
\quad \amp\Leftrightarrow \quad
(4x+1)^3 = -1
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
4x+1 = -1\\
\quad \amp\Leftrightarrow \quad
4x=-2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Hence \(f'(c)=0\) only when \(c=\dfrac{-1}{2}\text{.}\) That the derivative only has a single zero is very useful. It means (via Rolle's theorem) that if \(f(x)\) has distinct roots \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a \lt b\text{,}\) then we must have \(a  \lt  \dfrac{-1}{2}  \lt  b\text{.}\)  This also means that \(f(x)\) cannot have 3 distinct roots \(a,b\) and (say) \(q\) with \(a \lt b \lt q\text{,}\) because then Rolle's theorem would imply that \(f'(x)\) would have two zeros â€” one between \(a\) and \(b\) and another between \(b\) and \(q\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We've learned that \(f(x)\) has at most two roots, and we've learned something about where those roots can exist, if there are indeed two of them. But that means \(f(x)\) could have 0, 1, or 2 roots.</p>
<p>It's not easy to find a root of \(f(x)\) by inspection. But we can  get a good enough picture of the graph of \(y=f(x)\) to tell exactly how many roots there are, just by exploiting the following properties  of \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>As \(x\) tends to \(\pm \infty\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) tends to \(+\infty\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The derivative \(f'(x)=(4x+1)^3+1\) is negative for \(x \lt -\frac{1}{2}\) and is positive for \(x \gt -\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\) That is, \(f(x)\) is decreasing for \(x \lt -\frac{1}{2}\) and increasing for  \(x \gt -\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>\(f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{16}-\frac{1}{2} \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">This means the function must look something like the graph below:</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-212.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">except we are unsure of the locations of the \(x\)-intercepts. At present we only know that one is to the left of \(x=1/2\) and one is to the right.</p>
<p>Note what happens to \(f(x)\) as \(x\) increases from strongly negative values to strongly positive values.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When \(x\) is large and negative, \(f(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) decreases continuously until \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) where \(f(x) \lt 0\text{.}\) In particular, since \(f(-1)=\frac{65}{16} \gt 0\) and \(f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0\)  and \(f(x)\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that \(f(x)\) takes the value zero for some \(x\) between \(-\frac{1}{2}\) and \(-1\text{.}\) More descriptively put, as \(x\) increases from hugely negative numbers to \(-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) passes  through zero exactly once.</li>
<li>As \(x\) increases beyond  \(-\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) increases continuously, starting negative and becoming very large and positive when \(x\) becomes large and positive. In particular, since \(f(0)=\frac{1}{16} \gt 0\) and \(f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0\)  and \(f(x)\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that \(f(x)\) takes the value zero for some \(x\) between \(-\frac{1}{2}\) and \(0\text{.}\) So, as \(x\) increases from \(-\frac{1}{2}\) to near \(+\infty\text{,}\) \(f(x)\)  again passes through zero exactly once.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">So \(f(x)\) must have exactly two roots, one with \(x \lt -\frac{1}{2}\) and one with \(x \gt -\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</p>
