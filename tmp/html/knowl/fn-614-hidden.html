<body><div class="fn">This is called the implicit function theorem. We will not prove it. But it is not so hard to understand why it is true, if one thinks in terms of the Taylor expansion of \(G\) about the point. For simplicity, let's suppose that the point is \((0,0,0)\) and \(G\) happens to be exactly equal to its first order Taylor expansion about \((0,0,0)\text{.}\) That is, \(G(x,y,z) = A +Bx +Cy +Dz\text{,}\) for some constants \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) \(C\text{,}\) \(D\text{.}\) Since \((0,0,0)\) is on the surface, \(A=K\text{.}\) As \(\frac{\partial G}{\partial z}=D \ne 0\)  we can easily solve \(G(x,y,z)=K\) for \(z\) as a function of \(x\) and \(y\text{.}\) Namely \(z=\frac{1}{D}(-Bx-Cy)\text{.}\) The general proof is based on the fact that, under reasonable hypotheses, the first order Taylor expansion is a good approximation to \(G\) near \((0,0,0)\text{.}\)</div></body>
