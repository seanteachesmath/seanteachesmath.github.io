<p>We have already seen two different products involving vectors — the multiplication of a vector by a scalar and the dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors yields a scalar. We now introduce another product of two vectors, called the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">cross product</em>. The cross product of two vectors will give a vector. There are applications which have two vectors as inputs and produce one vector as an output, and which are related to the cross product. Here is a very brief mention of two such applications. We will look at them in much more detail later.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider a parallelogram in three dimensions. A parallelogram is naturally determined by the two vectors that define its sides. One measure of the size of a parallelogram is its area. One way to specify the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector that is perpendicular to it. A very compact way to encode both the area and the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane in which it lies and whose magnitude is its area. We shall see that such a vector can be easily constructed by taking the cross product (definition coming shortly) of the two vectors that give the sides of the parallelogram.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Imagine a rigid body which is rotating at a rate \(\Omega\) radians per second about an axis whose direction is given by the unit vector \(\hat\va\text{.}\) Let \(P\) be any point on the body. We shall see, in the (optional) §<a href="sec_vectors.html#sec_rot_motion" class="internal" title="Subsection 9.2.7: (Optional) Application of Cross Products to Rotational Motion">9.2.7</a>, that the velocity, \(\vv\text{,}\) of the point \(P\) is the cross product (again, definition coming shortly) of the vector \(\Om\hat\va\) with the vector \(\vr\) from any point on the axis of rotation to \(P\text{.}\)</p>
