<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\(f'(-1)\) does not exist, because to the left of \(x=-1\) the slope is a pretty big positive number (looks like around \(+1\)) and to the right the slope is \(-1/4\text{.}\) Since the derivative involves a limit, that limit needs to match the limit from the left and the limit from the right. The sharp angle made by the graph at \(x=-1\) indicates that the left and right limits do not match, so the derivative does not exist.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\(f'(3)\) also does not exist.  One way to see this is to notice that the function is discontinuous here. More viscerally, note that \(f(3)=1\text{,}\) so as we take secant lines with one endpoint \((3,1)\text{,}\) and the other endpoint just to the right of \(x=3\text{,}\) we get slopes that are more and more strongly negative, as shown in the picture below. If we take the limit of the slopes of these secant lines as \(x\) goes to \(3\) from the right, we get \(-\infty\text{.}\) (This certainly doesn't match the slope from the left, which is \(-\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\))</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">At \(x=-3\text{,}\) there is some kind of “change” in the graph; however, it is a smooth curve, so the derivative exists here.</p>
