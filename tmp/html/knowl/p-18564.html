<li>Suppose \(\vF\) is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives in the region \(D\text{,}\) where \(D\) is \(\bbbr^3\) without the origin.  If \(\vnabla\cdot\vF = 0\text{,}\)  then the flux of \(\vF\) through the sphere of radius \(5\) with center at the origin is \(0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Suppose \(\vF\) is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives in the region \(D\text{,}\) where \(D\) is \(\bbbr^3\) without the origin. If \(\vnabla\times\vF=\vZero\) then  \(\oint_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\) is zero, for every simple and smooth closed curve \(C\) in \(\bbbr^3\) which avoids the origin.</li>
<li>If a vector field \(\vF\) is defined and has continuous partial derivatives everywhere in \(\bbbr^3\text{,}\) and it satisfies \(\vnabla\cdot\vF  \gt  0\text{,}\) everywhere, then, for every sphere, the flux <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">out</em> of one hemisphere is larger than  the flux <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">into</em> the opposite hemisphere.</li>
<li>If \(\vr(t)\) is a path in \(\bbbr^3\) with constant curvature \(\kappa\text{,}\) then \(\vr(t)\) parametrizes part of a circle of radius \(1/\kappa\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The vector field \(\vF = \left( -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\,,\,\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}

<li>If all flow lines of a vector field in \(\bbbr^3\) are parallel to the \(z\)-axis, then the circulation of the vector field around every closed curve is \(0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If the speed of a moving particle is constant, then its acceleration is orthogonal to its velocity.</li>
