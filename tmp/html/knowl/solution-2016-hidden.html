<p>The chain rule gives us a relationship between \(\vb'(s)\) and \(\va'(t)\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\diff{\vb}{s}&amp;=\diff{}{s}[\va(t(s))]=\diff{\va}{t}\,\diff{t}{s}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So, the vectors \(\diff{\vb}{s}\) and \(\diff{\va}{t}\) differ only by the scalar function \(\diff{t}{s}\text{.}\) So, at any point along the curve, these vectors are parallel.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Furthermore, we know that \(t\) and \(s\) are positively correlated: as \(t\) increases, so does \(s\text{,}\) because we're covering more arclength. So, \(\diff{t}{s}\) is nonnegative. Furthermore, since the derivatives are nonzero, \(\diff{t}{s}\) is nonzero. So, \(\vb'(s_0)\) and \(\va'(t_0)\) are positive scalar multiples of each other. That is, they are parallel, and pointing in the same direction. However, unless \(\diff{t}{s}=1\) (that is, \(t(s)=s+C\) for some constant \(C\)), the vectors do not have the same magnitude, and hence are not equal.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">So, A is the best solution.</p>
