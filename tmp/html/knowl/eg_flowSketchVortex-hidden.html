Once we sketched the vector field, as in Figure <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_vortexField.html" title="Figure 13.1.6">13.1.6</a>, or even made the “skeleton sketch” of Figure <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_vortexCrude.html" title="Figure 13.1.5">13.1.5</a>, we can get rough idea of what the stream lines look like just by following the arrows. For example, suppose that we start a stream line (i.e. drop the stick into the stream) on the positive \(x\)-axis. Looking at Figure <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_vortexCrude.html" title="Figure 13.1.5">13.1.5</a>, which is repeated here,</p>

<p>the stick</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>starts by moving in the \(+y\) direction, i.e. straight upward.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the first quadrant it develops a larger and larger negative \(x\)-component of velocity. So it also moves leftwards toward the \(y\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the positive \(y\)-axis moving in the \(-x\) direction, i.e. to the left.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the second quadrant it develops a larger and larger negative \(y\)-component of velocity. So it also moves downwards toward the \(x\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the negative \(x\)-axis moving in the \(-y\) direction, i.e. straight downward.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the third quadrant it develops a larger and larger positive \(x\)-component of velocity. So it also moves rightward towards the \(y\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the negative \(y\)-axis moving in the \(+x\) direction, i.e. to the right.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the fourth quadrant it develops a larger and larger positive \(y\)-component of velocity. So it also moves upwards toward the \(x\)-axis.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">With this type of analysis we cannot tell if the streamline, which is the red line in the figure above, will return to the \(x\)-axis</p>

<li>exactly at its starting point, forming a closed curve, or</li>
<li>inside its starting point, spiralling inwards, or</li>
<li>outside its starting point, spiralling outwards.</li>
