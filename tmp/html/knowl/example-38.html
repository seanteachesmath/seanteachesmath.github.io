<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Where is the function \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{2+\cos(x)}\) continuous?</p>
<p>We just break things down into pieces and then put them back together keeping  track of where things might go wrong.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The function is a ratio of two pieces — so check if the numerator is  continuous, the denominator is continuous, and if the denominator might be zero.</li>
<li>The numerator is \(\sin(x)\) which is “continuous on its domain”  according to one of the above theorems. Its domain is all real  numbers <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-42-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, so it is  continuous everywhere. No problems here.</li>
<li>The denominator is the sum of \(2\) and \(\cos(x)\text{.}\) Since \(2\) is a constant  it is continuous everywhere. Similarly (we just checked things for the  previous point) we know that \(\cos(x)\) is continuous everywhere. Hence the  denominator is continuous.</li>
<li>So we just need to check if the denominator is zero. One of the facts  that we should know <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.6.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> is that<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
-1 \leq \cos(x) \leq 1\\
\end{gather*}
<p class="intertext">and so by adding 2 we get</p>
\begin{gather*}
1 \leq 2+\cos(x) \leq 3
\end{gather*}
</div>Thus no matter what value of \(x\text{,}\) \(2+\cos(x) \geq 1\) and so cannot be zero.</li>
<li>So the numerator is continuous, the denominator is continuous and  nowhere zero, so the function is continuous everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the function were changed to \(\ds \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2-5x+6}\) much of the same  reasoning can be used. Being a little terse we could answer with:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Numerator and denominator are continuous.</li>
<li>Since \(x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)\) the denominator is zero when \(x=2,3\text{.}\)</li>
<li>So the function is continuous everywhere except possibly  at \(x=2,3\text{.}\) In order to verify that the function really is discontinuous at  those points, it suffices to verify that the numerator is non-zero at \(x=2,3\text{.}\)  Indeed we know that \(\sin(x)\) is zero only when \(x = n\pi\) (for any integer  \(n\)). Hence \(\sin(2),\sin(3) \neq 0\text{.}\) Thus the numerator is non-zero, while the  denominator is zero and hence \(x=2,3\) really are points of discontinuity.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Note that this example raises a subtle point about checking continuity when  numerator and denominator are <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">simultaneously</em> zero. There are quite a  few possible outcomes in this case and we need more sophisticated tools to  adequately analyse the behaviour of functions near such points. We will return  to this question later in the text after we have developed Taylor expansions (see  Section <a href="sec_DIFFTaylor.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.4: Taylor Polynomials">4.4</a>).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-12.html#example-38">in-context</a></span>
