<p>For integration by parts, we want to break the integrand into two pieces, multiplied together. There is an obvious choice for how to do this: one piece is \(x\text{,}\) and the other is \(\log x\text{.}\) Remember that one piece will be integrated, while the other is differentiated. The question is, which choice will be more helpful. After some practice, you'll get the hang of making the choice. For now, we'll present both choices--but when you're writing a solution, you don't have to write this part down. It's enough to present your choice, and then a successful computation is justification enough.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In ExampleÂ <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_PRTSlnx.html" title="Example 6.7.8: \(\int \log x\dee{x}\)">6.7.8</a>, we found the antiderivative of logarithm, but it wasn't trivial. We might reasonably want to avoid using this complicated antiderivative. Indeed,  Option 2 (differentiating logarithm, antidifferentiating \(x\)) looks promising--when we multiply the blue equations, we get something easily integrable-- so let's not even bother going deeper into Option 1.</p>
<p>That is, we perform integration by parts with \(u=\log x\) and \(\dee{v}=x\,\dee{x}\text{,}\) so that \(\dee{u}=\frac{\dee{x}}{x}\) and \(v = \frac{x^2}{2}\text{.}\)</p>
