<p>This example is pretty simple, but this serves to illustrate some important points. If our function gives us a rule for taking elements in \(A\) and turning them into elements from \(B\) then</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the function must be defined for all elements of \(A\) — that is, no matter which element of \(A\) we choose, the function must be able to give us an answer. Every function must have this property.</li>
<li>on the other hand, we don't have to “hit” every element from \(B\text{.}\) In the above example, we miss almost all the letters in \(B\text{.}\) A function that does reach every element of \(B\) is said to be “surjective” or “onto”.</li>
<li>a given element of \(B\) may be reached by more than one element of \(A\text{.}\) In the above example, the days “Tuesday” and “Thursday” both map to the letter \(T\) and similarly the letters \(S\) is mapped to by both “Sunday” and “Saturday”. A function which does not do this, that is, every element in \(A\) maps to a different element in \(B\) is called “injective” or  “one-to-one” — again we will come back to this later when we discuss inverse function in <a href="sec_inverse_functions.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.6: Inverse Functions">Section 1.6</a>.</li>
</ul>
