<p>The set of all points in three dimensions is denoted \(\bbbr^3\text{.}\) The plane that contains, for example, the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes is called the \(xy\)-plane.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The \(xy\)-plane is the set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that satisfy \(z=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The \(xz\)-plane is the set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that satisfy \(y=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The \(yz\)-plane is the set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that satisfy \(x=0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">More generally,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that obey \(z=c\) is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and is a distance \(|c|\) from it. If \(c \gt 0\text{,}\) the plane \(z=c\) is above the \(xy\)-plane. If \(c \lt 0\text{,}\) the plane \(z=c\) is below the \(xy\)-plane. We say that the plane \(z=c\) is a signed distance \(c\) from the \(xy\)-plane.</li>
<li>The set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that obey \(y=b\) is a plane that is parallel to the \(xz\)-plane and is a signed distance \(b\) from it.</li>
<li>The set of all points \((x,y,z)\) that obey \(x=a\) is a plane that is parallel to the \(yz\)-plane and is a signed distance \(a\) from it.</li>
