<p>We have just seen that the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) per unit distance as we leave \((a,b)\) moving in direction \(\vv\) is a dot product, which we can write as</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vnabla f(a,b)\cdot\frac{\vv}{|\vv|}
=|\vnabla f(a,b)| \cos \theta
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(\theta\) is the angle between the gradient vector \(\vnabla f(a,b)\) and the direction vector \(\vv\text{.}\) Writing it in this way allows us to make some useful observations. Since \(\cos \theta\) is always between \(-1\) and \(+1\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the direction of maximum rate of increase is that having \(\theta=0\text{.}\) So to get maximum rate of increase per unit distance, as you leave \((a,b)\text{,}\) you should move in the same direction as the gradient \(\vnabla f(a,b)\text{.}\) Then the rate of increase per unit distance is \(|\vnabla f(a,b)|\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The direction of minimum (i.e. most negative) rate of increase  is that having \(\theta=180^\circ\text{.}\) To get minimum rate of increase per unit distance you should move in the direction opposite  \(\vnabla f(a,b)\text{.}\) Then the rate of increase per unit distance is \(-|\vnabla f(a,b)|\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The directions giving zero rate of increase are those perpendicular to \(\vnabla f(a,b)\text{.}\) If you move in a direction perpendicular to \(\vnabla f(a,b)\text{,}\) then \(f(x,y)\) remains constant as you leave \((a,b)\text{.}\) At that instant, you are moving so that \(f(x,y)\) remains constant and consequently you are moving along the level curve \(f(x,y)=f(a,b)\text{.}\)  So \(\vnabla f(a,b)\) is perpendicular to the level curve \(f(x,y)=f(a,b)\) at \((a,b)\text{.}\) The corresponding statement in three dimensions is that \(\vnabla F(a,b,c)\) is perpendicular to the level surface \(F(x,y,z)=F(a,b,c)\) at \((a,b,c)\text{.}\) Hence a good way to find a vector normal to the surface \(F(x,y,z)=F(a,b,c)\) at the point \((a,b,c\)) is to compute the gradient \(\vnabla F(a,b,c)\text{.}\) This is precisely what we saw back in Theorem <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_tan_plane_G.html" title="Theorem 10.5.5: Tangent Plane and Normal Line">10.5.5</a>.</li>
