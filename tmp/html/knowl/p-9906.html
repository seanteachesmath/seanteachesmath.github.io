<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Be careful to avoid a common mistake with telescoping series: if we look back at our account book, we see that every negative term will cancel with a positive term, with the initial \(+2\) as the only term that never cancels. Your friend takes $3, which they return the next day; then they take $4, which they return the next day; then they take $5, which they return the next day, and so on. It's extremely tempting to say that the series adds up to $2, since every other term cancels out eventually. This is where we lean on Definition <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_SRseries.html" title="Definition 8.2.3">8.2.3</a>: we evaluate the <em class="emphasis">partial sums</em>, which always leave your friend's last withdrawal unreturned. This definition makes sense: saying “I gained two bucks from this exchange” doesn't really capture the reality of your increasing debt.</p>
