<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">These boats are constructed with a heavy, often lead (which is cheap and dense), keel.  As a result, the centre of gravity is lower in the boat than the center of buoyancy, which, because the displaced fluid has constant density, is at the geometric centre of the boat. As the figure below illustrates, a right side up configuration of such a boat is stable, while an upside down configuration is unstable. The boat rotates so as to keep the centre of gravity straight below the centre of buoyancy. To see this pretend that you are holding on to the boat with one hand holding the centre of buoyancy and the other hand holding the centre of gravity. Use your hands to apply forces in the directions of the arrows and think about how the boat will respond.</p>
