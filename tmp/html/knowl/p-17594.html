<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this section, we derive the properties of torque that we used in the last section. Newton's law of motion says that the position \(\vr(t)\) of a single particle moving under the influence of a force \(\vF\) obeys \(m\vr''(t)=\vF\text{.}\) Similarly, the positions \(\vr_i(t)\text{,}\) \(1\le i\le n\text{,}\) of a set of particles moving under the influence of forces \(\vF_i\) obey \(m\vr_i''(t)=\vF_i\text{,}\) \(1\le i\le n\text{.}\) Very often systems of interest consist of some small number of rigid bodies. Suppose that we are interested in the motion of a single rigid body, say a piece of wood. The piece of wood is made up of a huge number<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-670-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.2.16"><sup> 16 </sup></a> of atoms. So the system of equations determining the motion of all of the individual atoms in the piece of wood is huge. On the other hand, we shall see that because the piece of wood is rigid, its configuration is completely determined by the position of, for example, its centre of mass and its orientation (we won't get into what precisely is meant by “orientation”, but it is certainly determined by, for example, the positions of a few of the corners of the piece of wood). To be precise, we shall extract from the  huge system of equations that determine the motion of all of the individual atoms, a small system of equations that determine the motion of the centre of mass and the orientation. We'll do so now.</p>
