<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Newton's law of motion says that the position \(x(t)\)  of a single particle moving under the influence of a force \(F\) obeys \(mx''(t)=F\text{.}\) Similarly, the positions \(x_i(t)\text{,}\)  \(1\le i\le n\text{,}\) of a set of particles moving under the influence of forces \(F_i\) obey \(mx_i''(t)=F_i\text{,}\) \(1\le i\le n\text{.}\) Often systems of  interest consist of some small number of rigid bodies. Suppose that  we are interested in the motion of a single rigid body, say a piece  of wood. The piece of wood is made up of a huge number of atoms.  So the system of equations determining the motion of all of the  individual atoms in the piece of wood is huge. On the other hand,  because the piece of wood is rigid, its configuration is completely  determined by the position of, for example, its centre of mass and  its orientation. (Rather than get into what is precisely meant by  “orientation”, let's just say that it is certainly determined by,  for example, the positions of a few of the corners of the piece of wood).  It is  possible to extract from the  huge system of equations that determine  the motion of all of the individual atoms, a small system of equations  that determine the motion of the centre of mass and the orientation.  We can avoid some vector analysis, that is beyond the scope of this  course, by assuming that our rigid body is moving in two rather than  three dimensions.</p>
