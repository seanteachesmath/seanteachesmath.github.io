<p>The function \(\ f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ \) has a particularly simple geometric interpretation — it is the distance from the point \((x,y)\) to the origin. So</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the minimum of \(f(x,y)\) is achieved at the point in the square that is nearest the origin — namely the origin itself. So \((0,0,0)\) is the lowest point on the surface and is at height \(0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The maximum of \(f(x,y)\) is achieved at the points in the square that are farthest from the origin — namely the four corners of the square \(\big(\pm 1,\pm 1\big)\text{.}\) At those four points \(z=\sqrt{2}\text{.}\) So the highest points on the surface are \((\pm 1,\pm 1,\sqrt{2})\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Even though we have already answered this question, it will be instructive to see what we would have found if we had followed our usual protocol. The partial derivatives of \(f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) are defined for \((x,y)\ne (0,0)\) and are</p>

\begin{equation*}
f_x(x,y) =\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\qquad
f_y(x,y) =\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}

<li>
<p>There are no critical points because</p>
<ul class="circle">

<li>\(f_y=0\) only for \(y=0\text{,}\) but</li>
<li>\((0,0)\) is not a critical point because \(f_x\) and \(f_y\) are not defined there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is one singular point — namely \((0,0)\text{.}\) The minimum value of \(f\) is achieved at the singular point.</li>
<li>The boundary of the square consists of its four sides. One side is<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">

</div>On this side \(f=\sqrt{1+y^2}\text{.}\) As \(\sqrt{1+y^2}\) increases with \(|y|\text{,}\) the smallest value of \(f\) on that side is \(1\) (when \(y=0\)) and the largest value of \(f\) is \(\sqrt{2}\) (when \(y=\pm 1\)). The same thing happens on the other three sides. The maximum value of \(f\) is achieved at the four corners. Note that \(f_x\) and \(f_y\) are both nonzero at all four corners.</li>
