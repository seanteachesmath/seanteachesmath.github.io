</h6>This example was  written in North America where the standard voltage supplied to homes is 120 volts. Most  of the rest of the world supplies homes with 240 volts. The main reason for this  difference is the development of the light bulb. The USA electrified earlier when the best  voltage for bulb technology was 110 volts. As time went on, bulb technology improved and  countries that electrified later took advantage of this (and the cheaper transmission  costs that come with higher voltage) and standardised at 240 volts. So many digressions in this section!</div>
