<ul class="disc">
<li>Let's begin by noticing that the domain of \(f(x)\) is \((-1,\infty)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>By inspection, \(f(0)=0\text{,}\) so \(f(x)\) has at least one root.</li>
<li>If \(x\in(-1,0)\text{,}\) then \((x+1)\) is positive, \(\log(x+1)\) is negative,  \(\sin(x)\) is negative, and \(-x^2\) is negative. Therefore, if \(x \lt 0\) is in the domain of \(f\text{,}\) then \(f(x) \lt 0\text{.}\) So, \(f(x)\) has no negative roots. We focus our attention on the case \(x \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>\(f'(x)=1-2x+\log(x+1)+\cos x\text{.}\)  We would like to know how many positive roots \(f'(x)\) has, but it isn't obvious. So, let's differentiate again.</li>
<li>\(f''(x)=-2+\frac{1}{x+1}-\sin x\text{.}\) When \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) \(\frac{1}{x+1} \lt 1\text{,}\) so \(f''(x)  \lt -1-\sin(x) \leq 0\text{,}\) so \(f''(x)\) has <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">no positive roots</em>. Since \(f'(x)\) is continuous and differentiable over \((0,\infty)\text{,}\) and since \(f''(x) \neq 0\) for all \(x \in (0, \infty)\text{,}\) by Rolle's Theorem, \(f'(x)\) has at most one root in \([0,\infty)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since \(f(x)\) is continuous and differentiable over \([0,\infty)\text{,}\) and \(f'(x)\) has at most one root in \((0,\infty)\text{,}\) by Rolle's Theorem \(f(x)\) has at most two distinct roots in \([0,\infty)\text{.}\) (Otherwise, \(f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=0\) for some values \(0\le a \lt b \lt c\text{,}\) so \(f'(d)=f'(e)=0\) for some \(d\in(a,b)\) and some \(e \in (b,c)\text{,}\) but since \(f'(x)\) has at most one root, this is impossible.)</li>
<li>
<p>We know \(f(0)=0\text{,}\) so the remaining question is whether or not \(f(x)\) has a second root (which would have to be positive). As usual, we can show another root exists using the intermediate value theorem. We see that for large values of \(x\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) is negative, for example:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(4)=5\log 5+\sin(4)-(4)^2  \lt   5\log(e^2) + 1 -16 =11-16 \lt 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For positive values of \(x\) closer to zero, we hope to find a positive value of \(f(x)\text{.}\) However, it's quite difficult to get a number \(c\) that obviously gives \(f(c) \gt 0\text{.}\) It suffices to observe that \(f(0)=0\) and \(f'(0)=2 \gt 0\text{.}\) From the definition of the derivative, we can conclude \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) (If it is not true that \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) then \(f(x)\le 0\) for all \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) The definition of the derivative tells us that [since \(f'(0)\) exists] \(f'(0)=\ds\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\ds\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(h)}{h}\text{;}\) the denominator is positive, so if the numerator were always less than or equal to zero, the limit would be less than or equal to zero as well. However, the derivative is positive, so \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{.}\)) Therefore, \(f(x)\) has a second root, so \(f(x)\) has precisely two roots.</p>
