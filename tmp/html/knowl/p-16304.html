<ul class="disc">
<li>starts by moving in the \(+y\) direction, i.e. straight upward.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the first quadrant it develops a larger and larger negative \(x\)-component of velocity. So it also moves leftwards toward the \(y\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the positive \(y\)-axis moving in the \(-x\) direction, i.e. to the left.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the second quadrant it develops a larger and larger negative \(y\)-component of velocity. So it also moves downwards toward the \(x\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the negative \(x\)-axis moving in the \(-y\) direction, i.e. straight downward.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the third quadrant it develops a larger and larger positive \(x\)-component of velocity. So it also moves rightward towards the \(y\)-axis.</li>
<li>Eventually it crosses the negative \(y\)-axis moving in the \(+x\) direction, i.e. to the right.</li>
<li>As it moves farther into the fourth quadrant it develops a larger and larger positive \(y\)-component of velocity. So it also moves upwards toward the \(x\)-axis.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">With this type of analysis we cannot tell if the streamline, which is the red line in the figure above, will return to the \(x\)-axis</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>exactly at its starting point, forming a closed curve, or</li>
<li>inside its starting point, spiralling inwards, or</li>
<li>outside its starting point, spiralling outwards.</li>
