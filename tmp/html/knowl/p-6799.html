<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">At first glance, multiplying the red functions and multiplying the blue functions give largely equivalent integrands to what we started with--none of them with obvious antiderivatives. In previous questions, we were able to choose \(u=x\text{,}\) and then \(\dee{u}=\dee{x}\text{,}\) so the “\(x\)” in  the integrand effectively went away. Here, we see that choosing \(u=x^3\) will lead to \(\dee{u}=3x^2\dee{x}\text{,}\) which has a lower power. If we repeatedly perform integration by parts, choosing \(u\) to be the power of \(x\) each time, then after a few iterations it should go away, because the third derivative of \(x^3\) is a constant.</p>
