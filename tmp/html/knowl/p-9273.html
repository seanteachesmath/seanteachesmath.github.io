<p>As a result,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>if \(P(0)=0\text{,}\) the graph starts out horizontally. In other words, as \(t\) starts to increase, \(P(t)\) remains at zero, so the slope of the graph remains at zero. The population size remains zero for all time. As a check, observe that  the function \(P(t)=0\) obeys \(\diff{P}{t}(t)=\big(6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\)  for all \(t\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Similarly, if \(P(0)=2000\text{,}\) the graph again starts out  horizontally. So \(P(t)\) remains at \(2000\) and the slope remains at zero.  The population size remains 2000 for all time. Again, the function  \(P(t)=2000\) obeys \(\diff{P}{t}(t)=\big(6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\) for all \(t\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(P(0)=1000\text{,}\) the graph starts out with positive slope. So \(P(t)\) increases with \(t\text{.}\) As \(P(t)\) increases towards 2000, the slope \((6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\text{,}\) while remaining positive, gets closer and closer to zero. As the graph approaches height 2000, it becomes more and more  horizontal. The graph cannot actually cross from below 2000 to above 2000, because to do so it would have to have strictly positive slope for  some value of \(P\) above 2000, which is not allowed.</li>
<li>If \(P(0)=3000\text{,}\) the graph starts out with negative slope. So \(P(t)\) decreases with \(t\text{.}\) As \(P(t)\) decreases towards 2000, the slope \((6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\text{,}\) while remaining negative, gets closer and closer to zero. As the graph approaches height 2000, it becomes more and more  horizontal. The graph cannot actually cross from above 2000 to below 2000, because to do so it would have to have negative slope for some value of \(P\) below 2000, which is not allowed.</li>
