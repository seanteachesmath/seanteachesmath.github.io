</h6>The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) developed these laws during the course of an attempt to relate the five extraterrestrial planets then known to the five Platonic solids. He based the laws on a great number of careful measurements made by the Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). Then Isaac Newton (English, 1642–1727) provided the explanation in 1687. Kepler also wrote a paper entitled “On the Six-Cornered Snowflake”. Tycho Brahe lost his nose in a sword duel and wore a prosthetic nose from then on. The story is that Brahe died from a burst bladder that resulted from his refusing to leave the dinner table before his host.</div>
