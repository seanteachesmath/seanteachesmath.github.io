<p>The position of an airplane at time \(t\) is given by \(x=y=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}t^{3/2},\ z=t(2-t)\) from take-off at \(t=0\) to landing at \(t=2\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>What is the total distance the plane travels on this flight?</li>
<li>Find the radius of curvature \(\ka\) at the apex of the flight, which occurs at \(t=1\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Two external forces are applied to the plane during the flight: the force of gravity \(\vG=-M g\,\hk\text{,}\) where \(M\) is the mass of the plane and \(g\) is a constant; and a friction force \(\vF=-|\vv|^2\vv\text{,}\) where \(\vv\) is the velocity of the plane. Find the work done by each of these forces during the flight.</li>
<li>One half-hour later, a bird follows the exact same flight â€” path as the plane, travelling at a constant speed \(v=3\text{.}\) One can show that at the apex of the path, i.e. when the bird is at \(\big(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3},\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3},1\big)\text{,}\) the principal unit normal \(\hN\) to the path points in the \(-\hk\) direction. Find the bird's (vector) acceleration at that moment.</li>
