<li>It is often (but not always) the case that, when \(f(x)\) has a local maximum at \(x=c\text{,}\) the function \(f(x)\) increases strictly as \(x\) approaches \(c\) from the left and decreases strictly as \(x\) leaves \(c\) to the right. That is, \(f'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x\) just to the left of \(c\) and \(f'(x) \lt 0\) for \(x\) just to the right of \(c\text{.}\) Then, it is often the case, because \(f'(x)\) is decreasing as \(x\) increases through \(c\text{,}\) that \(f''(c) \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Conversely, if \(f'(c)=0\) and \(f''(c) \lt 0\text{,}\) then, just to the right of \(c\) \(f'(x)\) must be negative, so that \(f(x)\) is decreasing, and  just to the left of \(c\) \(f'(x)\) must be positive, so that \(f(x)\) is increasing. So \(f(x)\) has a local maximum at \(c\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Similarly, it is often the case that, when \(f(x)\) has a local minimum at \(x=c\text{,}\) \(f'(x) \lt 0\) for \(x\) just to the left of \(c\) and \(f'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x\) just to the right of \(c\) and \(f''(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Conversely, if \(f'(c)=0\) and \(f''(c) \gt 0\text{,}\) then, just to the right of \(c\) \(f'(x)\) must be positive, so that \(f(x)\) is increasing, and, just to the left of \(c\) \(f'(x)\) must be negative, so that \(f(x)\) is decreasing. So \(f(x)\) has a local minimum at \(c\text{.}\)</li>
