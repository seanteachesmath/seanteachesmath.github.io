<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One last application of DefinitionÂ <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_AVaverage.html" title="Definition 7.2.2">7.2.2</a>. The following theorem can be  thought of as an analogue of the mean-value theorem (which was covered in your  differential calculus class) but for integrals. The theorem says that a  continuous function has to take its average value exactly somewhere. For example, if you  went for a drive along the \(x\)-axis and you were at \(x(a)\) at time \(a\) and at \(x(b)\) at  time \(b\text{,}\) then your velocity \(x'(t)\) had to be exactly your average velocity \(\frac{x(b)-x(a)}{b-a}\) at some time \(t\) between \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) In particular, if your average velocity was greater than the speed limit, you were definitely speeding at some point during the trip. This is, of course, no great surprise.</p>
