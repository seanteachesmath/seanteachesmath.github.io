<p>Since we have not seen too many theorems yet, let us examine it carefully piece  by piece.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">Let \(a,c \in \mathbb{R}\)</em> — just as was the case for  definitions, we start a theorem by defining terms and setting the scene. There  is not too much scene to set: the symbols \(a\) and \(c\) are real numbers.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">The following two limits hold</em> — this doesn't really  contribute much to the statement of the theorem, it just makes it easier to  read.</li>
<li>\(\ds \mathbf{\lim_{x \to a} c  = c}\)  — when we take the  limit of a  constant function (for example think of \(c=3\)), the limit is (unsurprisingly)  just that same constant.</li>
<li>\(\ds \mathbf{\lim_{x \to a} x = a}\) — as we noted above for general  polynomials, the limit of the function \(f(x) = x\) as \(x\) approaches a given  point \(a\text{,}\) is just \(a\text{.}\) This says something quite obvious — as \(x\) approaches  \(a\text{,}\) \(x\) approaches \(a\) (if you are not convinced then sketch the graph).</li>
