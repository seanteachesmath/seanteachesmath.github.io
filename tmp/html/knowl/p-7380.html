<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the examples above we used the partial fractions method to decompose rational  functions into easily integrated pieces. Each of those examples was quite involved and we  had to spend quite a bit of time factoring and doing long division. The key step in each  of the computations was Step 3 — in that step we decomposed the rational function \(\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}\) (or \(\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}\)), for which the degree of the numerator is strictly smaller than the degree of the denominator, into a sum of particularly simple rational functions, like \(\frac{A}{x-a}\text{.}\) We did not,  however, give a systematic description of those decompositions.</p>
