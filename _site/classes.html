<ul>
  <li>MATH 1113 Mathematics for General Education</li>
  <li><strong>MATH 2153 Bio-Calculus</strong> This class uses custom materials that have
substantially devolved from the inspiring textbook <em>Modeling the
Dynamics of Life</em> by Fred Adler, developed jointly with Brittany
Bannish.</li>
  <li>MATH 2313 Calculus I</li>
  <li><strong>MATH 2753 Technology for Professional Mathematics and Statistics</strong>
This class uses custom materials that have been developed to introduce
software for mathematical typesetting, introductory numerical computing,
and introductory symbolic manipulation.</li>
  <li>MATH 3103 Differential Equations</li>
  <li><strong>MATH 49/5910 Introduction to Biological Dynamics</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MATH 4263/5373 Applied Numerical Analysis</strong> This class limps along
using the oldest possible edition of the great book <em>Numerical Analysis</em>
by Burden and Faires. I try to spice it up by doing interesting things with the order of topics and bringing in more modern, but still accessible, research papers and reviews.</li>
  <li><strong>MATH 49/5910 Industrial Applications</strong></li>
  <li>STAT 4113 Mathematical Statistics I - I get to teach a class using my
own copy of <em>Freundâ€™s Mathematical Statistics</em> (from when I took the class
myself)!</li>
