Suddenly, we have gone from a lifetime of use on a watch battery and solar cell, to something on the order of a half a liter of water for every 100 words of email.\nWe are plagued by the pursuit of innovation, when sometimes we should just stick to “stuff that works”. Does AI have a place in higher education, sure? I just don’t want to hear about it every single day.\nThinking of “stuff that works”, good solid fundamentals, made me think of this table1\n\n\n\nTraining needed\nMAA\nNRC\nAAAS\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\nInferential statistics\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\nMultivariate statistics\nx\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecalculus (functions, graphical representations)\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\nDiscrete mathematics, matrix algebra, qualitative graphs\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\nCalculus topics: rates of change, summation, optimization\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\nSeries\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nDifferential equations\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nDynamical systems (continuous, discrete)\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\nModeling/simulation\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\nStochastic processes\nx\nx\nx\nX\n\n\n\nThis suggests that people have pretty lofty goals but are willing to stand on pretty rickety ladders to reach towards them. It’s hard to imagine confidently working with or understanding stochastic processes and dynamical systems as mathematical models. And those depend on differential, linear algebra, and calculus, and not necessarily in any particular order.\nEven listing these topics in order hides the truth, they are their best when interconnected, jumbled, even connected to other new things. Pilots and surgeons should use checkboxes, perhaps not everyone else, or at least for everything else. But, if we proceed one step at a time, answer by answer, asking for but not thinking about the answer, we have learned nothing."

    "text": "Wasn’t learning the fun part? Any time some sort of cheating incident occurs, the refrain begins “it wasn’t about the answer, it was about the process.” The emphasis isn’t on the final product as much as it is the research process, the note-taking, the accidental learning along the way. Ideally, even the understanding of the process itself. With AI-heavy teaching or learning, what is the process? Typing some words, to get other words which are then copied and pasted? What is gained? What is lost? Aside from the electricity, the water, the interaction, the opportunity for potentially-life shifting advice at any moment, and quite possibly, the truth.\nThe longer you do or teach something like math, if you really think about it, you become skeptical of some of its conventions. Pages and pages of “answers” in the form of integral tables to begin or end the book. Thinking is the fun part, not matching problem to answer. I am thinking here of a student that once requested I take a look at a grade after they had impressively used a memorized table of integrals to simply write down the answer to the question, more briefly and in a slightly different form than I was expecting. But, in doing so, missed the opportunity to demonstrate the process which illustrated why the solution emerged.\nBy thinking just one problem at a time, this student, as have many others, missed out on understanding how that problem fit into the context of others like it. That’s the learning."

I get that we ultimately find ourselves “checking answers” and those wind up shaping grades, but the answer is just sort of an indicator of the practice and work that came before it. The process is so much more enjoyable, for everyone, when we are all on the same team."
