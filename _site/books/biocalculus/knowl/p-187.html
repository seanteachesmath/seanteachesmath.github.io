<p>The integrated rate laws are the calculus of chemistry.  A law is an equation; a rate law is an equation about rates or a "differential equation".  An integrated rate law is the equation that results from performing integration on a differential equation to solve for the unknown.  In the chemistry setting we look for functions that describe the concentration of a chemical (or chemicals) of interest during a reaction.</p>
