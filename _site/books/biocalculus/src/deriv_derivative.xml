<title> Motivation for derivatives</title>

We will extend our notion of slope to allow ourselves to
make precise descriptions of how values of all functions, not just
linear functions, change.

<p>
Average and instantaneous rates of change. Consider the function f(t),
perhaps describing the position of a frog while it crosses a pond,
graphed below. Assume that <m>f</m> is measured in meters and <m>t</m>
in seconds.

<title> The limit definiton of the derivative</title>
<introduction>
<p>
We will extend our notion of slope to allow ourselves to
make precise descriptions of how values of all functions, not just
linear functions, change.
</p>
</introduction>
<p>
The slope of the secant line that connects the points <m>(a, f(a))</m>
and <m>(b, f(b))</m> on the graph of <m>f(t)</m> is,
<me>
m_{\text{sec}} =\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta t},
</me>
which we call the <term>average rate of change</term> of <m>f(t)</m>
between <m>t =
a</m> and <m>t = b</m>, in meters per second.
By bringing <m>b</m> closer and closer to <m>a</m>, our secant line
ecomes a tangent line. To do this we introduce a limit,
<me>
m_{\text{tan}} = \lim_{b\to a} \dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
</me>
which we call the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> of
<m>f(t)</m> at <m>t = a</m>, again in
meters per second.
</p>

<remark xml:id="rmk-aside-lim-def">
<title>Mathematical aside (<m>b \to a</m> vs. <m>\Delta t \to
0</m>)</title>
<statement>
<p>
Last time in our limit definition, we used the
limit as <m>\Delta t \to 0</m>. We will briefly show why that is
equivalent to the
approach above and computationally easier. Since <m>\Delta t = b 
a</m>, we have <m>b =
a+\Delta t</m>. Taking <m>b \to a</m> is the same as taking <m>\Delta t
\to 0</m>. Substitute <m>b = a+\Delta t</m> in
the definition for <m>m_{\text{tan}}</m> and simplify,
<me>
\begin{aligned}[t]
m_{\text{tan}} \amp = \lim_{b\to a}\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\
amp = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta t)-f(a)}{(a+\Delta t)-a}\\
m_{\text{tan}} amp = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta
t)-f(a)}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
</me>

<definition xml:id="def-derivative">
<title>derivative</title>
<statement>
<p>
The <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> at <m>t=a</m> to be the
<term>slope of the tangent line</term> to <m>f(t)</m> at <m>t=a</m>,
given by the
<term>derivative</term> <m>f'(a)</m>, below,

<me>
\text{inst. rate of change} = m_{tan} = f'(a) =
\dfrac{df}{dt}\Big|_{t=a} = \lim_{\Delta
t\to 0}\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta
t\to 0}\dfrac{f(a+\Delta t)-f(a)}{\Delta t}
</me>
inside this limit, the change in output is <m>\Delta f = f(a+\Delta
t)-f(a)</m> while the change in input is simply <m>\Delta t</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<remark xml:id="rmk-derivative">
<title>Notation (in the definiton)</title>
<statement>
<p>
Rather than using the two symbols required to
write <m>\Delta t</m>, we often use a single symbol <m>h</m> to denote
the change
from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> in the definition (and in the picture above).
This
amounts to saying that <m>b= a+h</m> rather than <m>b=a+\Delta t</m>
(since
<m>h=\Delta t</m>), so that the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>
is
<me>f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</me>
</p>
</statement>
</remark>


<remark xml:id="rmk-derivative2">
<title>Notation (using derivatives)</title>
<statement>
<p>
For a function <m>f(x)</m>, the derivative is written using the notation

<me>\text{prime}\rightarrow f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx} \leftarrow
\text{differential},</me>

and is to be interpreted in any of the three following ways,
<ol>
<li><p><em>intuitively</em> as the instantaneous rate of change</p></li>
<li><p><em>geometrically</em> as the slope of the tangent line</p></li>
<li><p><em>mathematically</em> as <m>\displaystyle f'(x) =
\dfrac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}</m></p></li>

<title>differentiable</title>
<statement>
<p>
A function <m>f</m> is <term>differentiable</term> at the
point a if the function has a well-defined tangent line with finite
slope at point <m>a</m>. If we say a function is differentiable without
mentioning a particular point, we mean it is differentiable everywhere.

<remark xml:id="rmk-higher-derivatives">
<title>Higher derivatives</title>
<statement>
<p>
We will learn how to interpret some higher
derivatives soon, but we can already differentiate quite a few
functions. We wll cover this soon, but you might as well try computing
the second derivatives, as illustrated below.
<me>
\begin{aligned}[t]
\text{first derivative} \amp = f'(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f(x)\Big) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(the function\Big)\\
 \text{second derivative} \amp = f''(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(f'(x)\Big) = \dfrac{d}{dx}\Big(the derivative\Big)
\end{aligned}
</me>
The mechanics are just the same. For problems involving exponentials and
logarithms be sure to simplify as fully as possible first using logarithm
rules, otherwise we might not know what to do to compute the derivative!
