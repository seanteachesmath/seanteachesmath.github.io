<title>Applications of integration to chemistry</title>
<introduction>
<p>
The integrated rate laws are the calculus of chemistry.  A law is an
equation; a rate law is an equation about rates or a "differential
equation".  An integrated rate law is the equation that results from
performing integration on a differential equation to solve for the
unknown.  In the chemistry setting we look for functions that describe
the concentration of a chemical (or chemicals) of interest during a
reaction.
