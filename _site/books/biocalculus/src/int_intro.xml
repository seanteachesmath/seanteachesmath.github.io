<title>Applications of derivatives: differential equations</title>
<introduction>
<p>
So far we have built methods and skills that allow us to take derivatives of known functions. When we revisit derivatives at the end of the semester, we will see quite a few more applications of derivatives. For now switch perspective and build systematic methods that allow us figure out what original function that a particular derivative comes from.
</p>
</introduction>
<p>
 Methods. To find what original function a derivative comes from,
we might
<ol>
<li>guess the original function</li>
<li>graph the original function (from behaviors encoded by the
derivative)</li>
<li>approximate the graph of the original function (Eulers
method/tangent line approximations)  skipped</li>
<li>integrate to find the original function</li>
</ol>
</p>
<definition xml:id="differential-equation">
<statement>
<p>
A <term>differential equation</term> (often shortened DE) describes
the instantaneous rate of change of a measurement.
<ul>
<li> <p>
a <term>pure-time DE</term> is of the form <m>\dfrac{dp}{dt} =
f(t)</m> where the instantaneous rate of change of <m>p(t)</m> is

<li> <p>

<title>Classifying DEs</title>
<statement>
<p>
Identify whether each of the following is a pure-time or autonomous differential equation for the given variable:
<ol>
<li><p> <m>\dfrac{dp}{dt} = e^{-t}</m></p></li>
<li><p> <m>\dfrac{dn}{dt} = 2n</m></p></li>
<li><p> <m>\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2x\Big(1-\dfrac{x}{10}\Big)</m></p></li>

<ol>
<li><p> <m>\dfrac{dp}{dt} = e^{-t}</m> is a pure-time DE for the variable <m>p</m></p></li>

<example xml:id="ex-walking">
<title>Velocity during a walk</title>
<statement>
<p>
Velocity, the instantaneous change in position, of a moving person is
given by
the pure-time DE <m>\dfrac{dp}{dt} = 1.8</m>,
where position <m>p(t)</m> is the quantity being differentiated with
respect to time. Find the solution <m>p(t)</m>, that satisfies the differential
equation.
</p>
<p>
We have to options: Guess it, Graph it.
</p>
<solution>
<p>Guessing involves thinking of what original function has a derivative of
1.8, based on our experience of taking derivatives.  If our derivative
is the constant function <m>1.8</m>, what was the original function
<m>p(t)</m>? In other words, "the derivative of <em>what</em> is <m>1.8</m>?"</p>

<remark xml:id="re-notation">
<title>Notation for pure-time DEs</title>
<p>
In general, we study a pure-time differential equation
<m>\dfrac{dF}{dt} = f(t)</m>.
Solving this pure-time DE for the unknown function <m>F(t)</m> involves
finding the function whose derivative is <m>f(t)</m>. We want to undo
the derivative to find <m>F(t)</m>, called the antiderivative of
<m>f(t)</m>.

An antiderivative of the function <m>f(t)</m> is a function <m>F(t)</m>

equal to the integral of <m>f</m> of <m>t</m> with respect to <m>t</m>"", and we write
