# The Joy of X

This will be about the time that I tried to teach a liberal arts math class using *The Joy of X*.

To be honest, this was an idea I had first reading Steven Strogatz's columns in the New York Times during graduate school. When I had the opportunity to build a math class around a $9 book, most of which was available online, I tried it. But, this was Spring 2020, which in some respects hardly existed.

I still have vivid memories of the class and the plan, and maybe someday I'll revisit the idea.
