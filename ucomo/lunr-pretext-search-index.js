  "body": " Building and Flying Paper Airplanes    Paper Airplane Instructions  Each of the videos below walks you through the steps in making a different type of paper airplane pictured below. The only thing that you will need for your airplanes is paper (copy, notebook, or construction paper will work). Although paper is the only material required, something to help crease down folds might also be useful, like a coin, ruler, or pen\/pencil; also tape would help secure your planes' wings.   Examples from your fleet of airplanes.     You can also make your paper airplanes out of alternative materials such as napkins; use whatever you have on hand!  Once you have all your supplies, watch the videos. Feel free to watch at the speed you are most comfortable with (faster or slower), pausing and replaying whenever you need. And, don't forget to have fun!  It might be interesting to see how each design performs depending on the paper material used. This is something you can play around with in the Paper Airplane Log.   Video Links      Pink Paper Airplane    The Dart\/Gray Paper Airplane    White Paper Airplane    The Bat\/Light Blue Paper Airplane    Green Paper Airplane    Light Pink Paper Airplane    Purple Airplane   Blue Paper Airplane     Paper Airplane Designs        Disclaimer: The Girls Get Math program did not create the designs of the 8 paper airplanes that are provided. These designs existed before the program and were created by other individuals.       Paper Airplane Log Instructions  Mathematicians and scientists conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. These hypotheses are created to ask questions about the world around them. Using the Paper Airplane Log below, you will be conducting your own experiment to find the best paper airplane design out of the 8 provided.  Once you have successfully folded multiple airplanes of each design, you will fly them and record your findings. As with any experiment, there are tons of variables that can be measured, each of which will contribute to the design's title as \"best\". And, like other experiments, multiple attempts must be done to ensure that your results are accurate. So, start by making 3 paper airplanes for each design. Once you have done this, read through the log to get a feel for what should be measured in every test.     Testing your airplanes.      The Paper Airplane Log asks that you measure the plane's distance from a target as well as the distance from your plane flown in Round 1. In both of these cases, try to aim your airplane in the same spot each time. The closer your planes are to this spot (the target), the more accurate this design is. The closer your planes are from each other (i.e. small distances measured from where the plane from Round 1 landed), the more precise this design is.  If your idea of a perfect airplane is one that hits its target in the center every time, then precision and accuracy are the characteristics you are looking for.   Paper Airplane Log Files   Digital Versions:   If you are using the digital version, you will have to download or copy the file to edit it.   Google Sheet (Color)  Google Sheet (Black and White)   Printable Versions:   PDF (Color)  PDF (Black and White)      Start Flying your Airplanes   Pull up your phone's stopwatch; get a friend to count out loud; have a parent\/guardian measure the distance with a ruler or yardstick; put up trashcans and blankets as targets. Get creative! Whatever, and however, you chose to measure when flying your paper airplanes is up to you. Remember that the objective of your experiment is to find the best paper airplane design, so figure out what you think makes a paper airplane the best (fastest, furthest flying, most accurate\/precise) and test for that.

  "body": " Logic and Proofs   Introduction to Logic and Propositions  In this module, you will learn about truth values, propositions, logic tables, and lastly proofs. In higher math courses, logic and proofs are used all the time to explain mathematical realtionships; for example, proofs are used to show whether a number is even, odd, prime, or divisible.  In this activity, you will start off by learning the basics surrounding propositions, truth values, and logic tables. Attached below are guided notes and a video to get you started on your journey to start solving mathematical proofs.   Guided Notes and Video    Truth Tables and Propositions Video     Digital Versions:   If you are using the digital version, you will have to download or copy the file to edit it.   Word Docx (Color)  Word Docx (Black and White)   Printable Versions:   PDF (Color)  PDF (Black and White)       Applications of logic   Now we provide you with a few mysteries to solve using the logic tools from above. \"Who ate the donut?\" has an interactive app that will walk you through how to solve the mystery. In \"Alligator's Missing Pen\", you will solve the mystery by a more hands on approach by writing a proof to solve the mystery. Solution videos are available for the first two activities if you happen to get stuck.    Who ate the last donut?   Someone ate the last donut in the box that was supposed to be split among Bird, Fox, and Panda. All three are suspects.   Suspects for \"Who ate the donut?\"     The three reach out to Detective Badger for help revealing the donut thief. She collects evidence surrounding the case and shares her findings below.   Detective Badger with the donut       Fact (True statement): “The donut was chocolate frosted.”  Evidence   Either Bird ate the donut or the donut was in the kitchen.  If the donut was chocolate frosted, the donut was in the kitchen this morning.  Fox ate the donut if and only if the donut had sprinkles.  The donut did not have sprinkles if it was in the kitchen this morning.     \"Who ate the donut?\" Interactive App     Donut Proof Example    Alligator's Missing Pen   Alligator seems to have lost their pen while running errands. In the process of picking up groceries, chatting with friends, and dropping off letters, the pen was dropped.   Alligator, Cat, and Detective Badger     Alligator enlisted the help of Detective Badger to find the missing pen. Can you help?    Fact (True statement): “Today is Monday, January 2nd\"  Evidence  Today is an even number day and Alligator visited Fox the Grocer second.  Alligator did not visit Raccoon, Alligator’s friend first if today is Monday.  If Alligator visited Fox the Grocer after Cat the Mail Deliverer or today is Tuesday, then Alligator dropped their pen at their first stop.        Alligator's Missing Pen Example    Start Solving   Now you are ready for \"Who won the raffle?\" proof activity. This activity will use everything you've learned so far in this module. Feel free to rewatch the videos, review the example problem, or reference your notes while trying to solve the problem. Also, working with others students on this activity is encouraged but not required. You can solve the mystery by using the \"Who won the raffle?\"\" interactive app or by writing a proof for the mystery, similar to \"Alligator's Missing Pen\". Goodluck on solving the mystery!    Who won the raffle?  An owl, toad, and raccoon bought raffle tickets. Later they gathered to watch the raffle number drawings. However, the lights went out during the party, and one of the animals tripped into the other animals causing them to all fall to the ground with their raffle tickets. When the power came back on, they found out one of the raffle tickets was the grand-prize winner, but they did not know who bought it.   Animals for \"Who won the raffle?\"     They decided to call Detective Badger to uncover the mystery. She collects evidence surrounding the case and shares her findings below.   Detective Bader with the raffle ticket       Fact (True statement): “Raffle ticket was covered in soda stains.”  Evidence  The raccoon is the winner if and only if the raffle ticket was not bought at the blue booth.  Either the soda was diet or the toad is the winner.  The soda was orange flavored implies that the raffle ticket was bought at the blue booth.  If the winner did not like soda, then the raffle ticket was not covered in soda stains.  The owl is the winner is necessary and sufficient for the raccoon is not the winner.  The winner likes soda if and only if the soda was diet and orange flavored.     \"Who won the raffle?\" Interactive App    A solution will be revealed near the conclusion of the program.   "

Objectives  Be the last player to add a line segment to the board. (This player is the winner.)  Predict who will win and who will lose based on the set up of the game.  Spot patterns and justify them.      Rules  To play, two players will alternate turns until one of the players is unable to make a move. Note: You can play this by yourself. This can be done by writing in two different colors. Designate one color as player one and the other as player two. To begin, decide who will play first then create a game board by drawing number of dots. On each turn, draw a segment between any pair of dots which does not intersect any of the existing segments. This is illustrated in      A valid play.    An invalid play.     The winner is the last person able to make a legal move. A completed game is shows in .    A valid play.    Make a copy of the score table based on the number of dots used. The first row has been filled in. These values can be seen based on the completed game illustrated in . However, in order to complete the rest of the table, you will need the following definitions:  The dots are called vertices and denoted by  The segments are called edges and denoted by  The outlined regions are called faces and denoted by          Winner       First Player                                   Based on the table, what patterns do you see?
