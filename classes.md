# Teaching
## Courses taught (or **developed**)
* MATH 1113 Mathematics for General Education
* **MATH 2153 Bio-Calculus** This class uses custom materials that have
substantially devolved from the inspiring textbook _Modeling the
Dynamics of Life_ by Fred Adler, developed jointly with Brittany
Bannish.
* MATH 2313 Calculus I
* **MATH 2753 Technology for Professional Mathematics and Statistics**
This class uses custom materials that have been developed to introduce
software for mathematical typesetting, introductory numerical computing,
and introductory symbolic manipulation.
* MATH 3103 Differential Equations
* **MATH 49/5910 Introduction to Biological Dynamics**
* **MATH 4263/5373 Applied Numerical Analysis** This class limps along
using the oldest possible edition of the great book _Numerical Analysis_
by Burden and Faires. I try to spice it up by doing interesting things with the order of topics and bringing in more modern, but still accessible, research papers and reviews.
* **MATH 49/5910 Industrial Applications**
* STAT 4113 Mathematical Statistics I - I get to teach a class using my
own copy of _Freund's Mathematical Statistics_ (from when I took the class
myself)!
